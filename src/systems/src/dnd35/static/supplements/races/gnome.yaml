name: Gnome
size: S
speed: 20
description: Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite the demand for their
  skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind, living in comfortable burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills
  where animals abound.
traits:
  - name: Low-light Vision
    description: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor
      illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
  - name: Weapon Familiarity
    description: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.
  - name: Illusory Studies
    description: "+2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions: Gnomes are innately familiar with illusions of all kinds."
  - name: Skilled Illusionist
    description: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. Their innate
      familiarity with these effects make their illusions more difficult to see through. This adjustment stacks with
      those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.
  - name: Common Enemy
    description: "+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and
      bugbears): Gnomes battle these creatures frequently and practice special techniques for fighting them."
  - name: Giant Hunter
    description: "+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants):
      This bonus represents special training that gnomes undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous
      generations developed in their battles with giants. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to
      Armor Class, such as when it’s caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too. The _Monster Manual_ has
      information on which creatures are of the giant type."
  - name: Keen Ears
    description: "+2 racial bonus on Listen checks: Gnomes have keen ears."
  - name: Natural Alchemist
    description: "+2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks: A gnome’s sensitive nose allows him to monitor alchemical
      processes by smell."
  - name: Automatic Languages
    description: Common and Gnome.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Orc. Gnomes deal more with elves and dwarves than elves and
      dwarves deal with one another, and they learn the languages of their enemies (kobolds, giants, goblins, and orcs)
      as well. In addition, a gnome can use speak with a burrowing mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit, or the like, see
      below). This ability is innate to gnomes.
  - name: Spell-Like Abilities
    description: "1/day — _speak with animals_ (burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of
      at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day — _dancing lights_, _ghost sound_,
      _prestidigitation_. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome’s Cha modifier + spell level."
  - name: Favored Class
    description: Bard. A multiclass gnome’s bard class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.
