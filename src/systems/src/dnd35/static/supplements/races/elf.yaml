name: Elf
size: M
speed: 30
description: Elves mingle freely in human lands, always welcome yet never at home there. They are well known for their
  poetry, dance, song, lore, and magical arts. Elves favor things of natural and simple beauty. When danger threatens
  their woodland homes, however, elves reveal a more martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and battle
  strategy.
traits:
  - name: Sleep Immunity
    description: Immunity to magic sleep effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.
  - name: Low-light Vision
    description: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor
      illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
  - name: Weapon Proficiency
    description: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite
      longbow), and shortbow (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats. Elves esteem the arts of swordplay and
      archery, so all elves are familiar with these weapons.
  - name: Keen Senses
    description: +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or
      concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it. An elf’s senses
      are so keen that she practically has a sixth sense about hidden portals.
  - name: Automatic Languages
    description: Common and Elven.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan. Elves commonly know the languages of their enemies and of
      their friends, as well as Draconic, the language commonly found in ancient tomes of secret knowledge.
  - name: Favored Class
    description: Wizard. A multiclass elf’s wizard class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience
      point penalty for multiclassing. Wizardry comes naturally to elves—indeed, they sometimes claim to have invented
      it, and fighter/wizards are especially common among them.
