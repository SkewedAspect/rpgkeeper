name: Fighter
description: The questing knight, the conquering overlord, the king’s champion, the elite foot soldier, the hardened
  mercenary, and the bandit king— all are fighters. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel
  marauders, or gutsy adventurers. Some are among the land’s best souls, willing to face death for the greater good.
  Others are among the worst, with no qualms about killing for private gain, or even for sport. Fighters who are not
  actively adventuring may be soldiers, guards, bodyguards, champions, or criminal enforcers. An adventuring fighter
  might call himself a warrior, a mercenary, a thug, or simply an adventurer.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light)
      and shields (including tower shields).
  - name: Bonus Feats
    description: At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level
      character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd
      level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus
      feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats in the PHB. A fighter must still meet all
      prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. These bonus feats are in
      addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. A fighter is not limited to the
      list of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.
