name: Monk
description: >-
  Dotted across the landscape are monasteries—small, walled cloisters inhabited by monks who pursue personal perfection
  through action as well as contemplation. They train themselves to be versatile warriors skilled at fighting without
  weapons or armor. The inhabitants of monasteries headed by good masters serve as protectors of the people. Ready for
  battle even when barefoot and dressed in peasant clothes, monks can travel unnoticed among the populace, catching
  bandits, warlords, and corrupt nobles unawares. In contrast, the residents of monasteries headed by evil masters rule
  the surrounding lands through fear, as an evil warlord and his entourage might. Evil monks make ideal spies,
  infiltrators, and assassins.


  The individual monk is unlikely to care passionately about championing commoners or amassing wealth. She cares
  primarily for the perfection of her art and, thereby, her personal perfection. Her goal is to achieve a state that is
  beyond the mortal realm.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk
      training. The weapons with which a monk is proficient are club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe,
      javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling. Monks are not proficient with any armor
      or shields—in fact, many of the monk’s special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a
      shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of
      blows abilities.
  - name: AC Bonus
    type: ex
    description: >-
      A monk is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated
      attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk
      gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th,
      +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).


      These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when
      she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium
      or heavy load.
  - name: Flurry of Blows
    type: ex
    description: >-
      When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make
      one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a –2 penalty, as does each
      other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack
      Column of the Monk Table. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk
      might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to –1, and at 9th level it
      disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.


      When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama,
      nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons
      interchangeably as desired. For example, at 6th level, the monk Ember could make one attack with her unarmed
      strike at an attack bonus of +3 and one attack with a special monk weapon at an attack bonus of +3. When using
      weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus × 1-1/2 or × 1/2) to her
      damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can’t use any
      weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.


      In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows
      ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with
      quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so. For example,
      an 8th-level monk could make two attacks with the quarterstaff (one with each end) at a +5 attack bonus and one
      with an unarmed strike at a +0 attack bonus, or she could attack with one end of the quarterstaff and one unarmed
      strike each at a +5 attack bonus, and with the other end of the quarterstaff at a +0 attack bonus, or she could
      attack with one end of the quarterstaff and one unarmed strike at a +5 attack bonus each, and with the other end
      of the quarterstaff at a +0 attack bonus. She cannot, however, wield any other weapon at the same time that she
      uses a quarterstaff.


      When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra
      attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.
  - name: Unarmed Strike
    description: >-
      Monks are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so. At 1st level, a
      monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk’s attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or
      even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There
      is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus
      on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.


      Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no
      penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.


      A monk’s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells
      and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons (such as the _magic fang_ and
      _magic weapon_ spells).


      A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would. A Small monk deals less damage
      than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage.


      | Level | Damage(Small Monk) | Damage(Large Monk) |

      |:-----:|:------------------:|:------------------:|

      | 1st-3rd | 1d4 | 1d8 |

      | 4th - 7th | 1d6 | 2d6 |

      | 8th - 11th | 1d8 | 2d8 |

      | 12th - 15th | 1d10 | 3d6 |

      | 16th - 19th | 2d6 | 3d8 |

      | 20th | 2d8 | 4d8 |
  - name: Bonus Feat
    description: At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she
      may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved
      Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these
      feats to select them.
  - name: Evasion
    type: ex
    description: A monk of 2nd level or higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a
      successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a
      red dragon’s fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is
      wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the
      benefit of evasion.
  - name: Fast Movement
    type: ex
    description: At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed. A monk in armor (even light armor) or
      carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.
  - name: Still Mind
    type: ex
    description: A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school
      of enchantment, since her meditation and training improve her resistance to mind-affecting attacks.
  - name: Ki Strike
    type: su
    description: At 4th level, a monk’s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic
      weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction.Ki strike improves with the
      character’s monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of
      dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine
      weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
  - name: Slow Fal
    type: ex
    description: At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm’s reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first
      using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk’s ability
      to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her
      monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.
  - name: Purity of Body
    type: ex
    description: At 5th level, a monk gains control over her body’s immune system. She gains immunity to all diseases except
      for supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot and lycanthropy).
  - name: Wholeness of Body
    type: su
    description: At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal
      to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.
  - name: Improved Evasion
    type: ex
    description: At 9th level, a monk’s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving
      throw against attacks such as a dragon’s breath weapon or a fireball, but henceforth she takes only half damage on
      a failed save. A help- less monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of
      improved evasion.
  - name: Diamond Body
    type: su
    description: At 11th level, a monk is in such firm control of her own metabolism that she gains immunity to poisons of
      all kinds.
  - name: Abundant Step
    type: su
    description: At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell _dimension door_,
      once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).
  - name: Diamond Soul
    type: ex
    description: At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the
      monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check that equals or exceeds the monk’s spell
      resistance.
  - name: Quivering Palm
    type: su
    description: Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can
      thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must
      announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and
      creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target
      takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at
      any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an
      attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving
      throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the
      target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another
      one at a later time.
  - name: Timeless Body
    type: ex
    description: Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be
      magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and
      the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.
  - name: Tongue of the Sun and Moon
    description: A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.
  - name: Empty Body
    type: su
    description: At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as
      though using the spell _etherealness_. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single
      day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
  - name: Perfect Self
    type: ex
    description: At 20th level, a monk has tuned her body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that she
      becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider (an extraplanar creature) rather than as a
      humanoid for the purpose of spells and magical effects. For instance, _charm person_ does not affect her.
      Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage
      from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t have similar
      damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member
      of her previous creature type.
