name: Wizard
description: >-
  A few unintelligible words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe, when they are the words and
  gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy, but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend
  poring over her spellbook preparing each spell for casting, and the years before that spent in apprenticeship to learn
  the arts of magic.


  Wizards depend on intensive study to create their magic. They examine musty old tomes, debate magical theory with
  their peers, and practice minor magics whenever they can. For a wizard, magic is not a talent but a difficult,
  rewarding art.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not
      with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard’s movements, which can cause her
      spells with somatic components to fail.
  - name: Spells
    description: >-
      A wizard casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and bards), which are drawn from the
      sorcerer/wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).


      To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell
      level (Int 10 for 0-level spells, Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving
      throw against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s Intelligence modifier.


      Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In
      addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.


      Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of
      time by getting a good night’s sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard
      decides which spells to prepare.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her
      race. Many ancient tomes of magic are written in Draconic, and apprentice wizards often learn it as part of their
      studies.
  - name: Familiar
    description: A wizard can obtain a familiar in exactly the same manner as a sorcerer can. See the sorcerer description
      and the accompanying Familiars sidebar for details.
  - name: Scribe Scroll
    description: At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. This feats enables her to create magic schools.
  - name: Bonus Feats
    description: >-
      At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a
      metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus
      feat, including caster level minimums.


      These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets every three levels. The wizard is
      not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.
  - name: Spellbooks
    description: >-
      A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her
      spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory.


      A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited
      school or schools, if any; plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the
      wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains
      two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook.
      For example, when a wizard attains 5th level, she can cast 3rd-level spells. At this point, she can add two new
      3rd-level spells to her spellbook, or one 2nd-level spell and one 3rd-level spell, or any combination of two
      spells between 1st and 3rd level. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to
      her own.
