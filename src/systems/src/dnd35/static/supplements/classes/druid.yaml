id: dnd35-class-druid
name: Druid
description: The fury of a storm, the gentle strength of the morning sun, the cunning of the fox, the power of the
  bear—all these and more are at the druid’s command. The druid however, claims no mastery over nature. That claim, she
  says, is the empty boast of a city dweller. The druid gains her power not by ruling nature but by being at one with
  it. To trespassers in a druid’s sacred grove, and to those who feel her wrath, the distinction is overly fine.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: >-
      Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear,
      sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they
      assume with wild shape (see below).


      Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear
      only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the _ironwood_
      spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but
      must use only wooden ones.


      A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her
      supernatural or spelllike class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
  - name: Spells
    description: >-
      A druid casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to the cleric, paladin, and ranger), which are
      drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral
      or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells
      in advance (see below).


      To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for
      0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a
      druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s Wisdom modifier.


      Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table 3–8: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has
      a high Wisdom score (see Table 1–1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page8). She does not have access to any
      domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.


      A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure
      spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell
      list (page 189), provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare
      during her daily meditation.
  - name: Spontaneous Casting
    description: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She
      can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any _summon nature’s ally_ spell of the same level or lower. For
      example, a druid who has prepared _repel vermin_ (a 4th-level spell) may lose _repel vermin_ in order to cast
      _summon nature’s ally_ IV (also a 4th-level spell).
  - name: Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells
    description: A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). For example,
      a neutral good druid cannot cast evil spells. Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the
      chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: >-
      A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to
      the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.


      A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level
      druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of
      languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
      Druidic has its own alphabet.
  - name: Animal Companion
    type: ex
    description: >-
      A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog,
      riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the DM’s
      campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the DM may add the following creatures to the
      druid’s list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that
      accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.


      A 1st-level druid’s companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted in the sidebar on page 36. As a
      druid advances in level, the animal’s power increases as shown on the table in the sidebar.


      If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24
      uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.


      A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see the sidebar). Should she select
      an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character’s druid
      level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the
      character’s druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table in the sidebar to determine
      the animal companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid’s effective level to 0 or lower, she
      can’t have that animal as a companion.) For example, a 6th-level druid could select a leopard as an animal
      companion. The leopard would have characteristics and special abilities as if the druid were 3rd level (taking
      into account the –3 adjustment) instead of 6th level.
  - name: Nature Sense
    type: ex
    description: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.
  - name: Wild Empathy
    type: ex
    description: >-
      A druid can use body language, vocaliza- tions, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear
      or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person
      (see Chapter 4: Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the
      wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals
      are usually unfriendly.


      To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be
      within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute
      but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.


      A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a
      basilisk or a girallon), but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.
  - name: Woodland Stride
    type: ex
    description: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
      overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and with- out taking damage or suffering any other
      impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion
      still affect her.
  - name: Trackless Step
    type: ex
    description: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may
      choose to leave a trail if so desired.
