name: Cleric
description: The handiwork of the gods is everywhere—in places of natural beauty, in mighty crusades, in soaring
  temples, and in the hearts of worshipers. Like people, gods run the gamut from benevolent to malicious, reserved to
  intrusive, simple to inscrutable. The gods, however, work mostly through intermediaries—their clerics. Good clerics
  heal, protect, and avenge. Evil clerics pillage, destroy, and sabotage. A cleric uses the power of his god to make his
  god’s will manifest. And if a cleric uses his god’s power to improve his own lot, that’s to be expected, too.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: >-
      Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with
      shields (except tower shields).


      Every deity has a favored weapon (see Deities), and his or her clerics consider it a point of pride to wield that
      weapon. A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to that weapon as a bonus feat.
      He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that
      category.
  - name: Aura
    type: ex
    description: A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the
      deity’s alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Clerics who don’t worship a specific deity but choose
      the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.
  - name: Spells
    description: >-
      A cleric casts divine spells (the same type of spells avail- able to the druid, paladin, and ranger), which are
      drawn from the cleric spell list (page 183). However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells
      opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose
      and prepare his spells in advance (see below).


      To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for
      0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a
      cleric’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s Wisdom modifier.


      Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table 3–7: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
      high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level.
      When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities,
      Domains, and Domain Spells, below).Clerics do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare
      them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them through their own strength of
      faith or as divine inspiration. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet
      contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Typically, this hour is at dawn or noon for
      good clerics and at dusk or midnight for evil ones. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can
      prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list (page 183), provided that he can
      cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.
  - name: Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells
    description: >-
      Choose a deity for your cleric. The cleric’s deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his
      values, and how others see him. You may also choose for your cleric to have no deity.


      If the typical worshipers of a deity include the members of a race, a cleric must be of the indicated race to
      choose that deity as his own.(The god may have occasional worshipers of other races, but not clerics.)


      When you have chosen an alignment and a deity for your cleric, choose two domains from among those given on Table
      3–7 for the deity. While the clerics of a particular religion are united in their reverence for their deity, each
      cleric emphasizes different aspects of the deity’s interests. You can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil,
      Good, or Law) for your cleric only if his alignment matches that domain.


      If your cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, you still select two domains to represent his spiritual
      inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.


      Each domain gives your cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as
      a granted power. Your cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected. With access to two domain
      spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain
      spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.


      For example, Jozan is a 1st-level cleric of Pelor. He chooses Good and Healing (from Pelor’s domain options) as
      his two domains. He gets the granted powers of both his selected domains. The Good domain allows him to cast all
      spells with the good descriptor at +1 caster level (as if he were one level higher as a cleric) as a granted
      power, and it gives him access to _protection from evil_ as a 1st-level domain spell. The Healing domain allows
      him to cast all healing subschool spells of the conjuration school at +1 caster level as a granted power, and it
      gives him access to _cure light wounds_ as a 1st-level domain spell. When Jozan prepares his spells, he gets one
      1st-level spell for being a 1st-level cleric, one bonus 1st-level spell for having a high Wisdom score (15), and
      one domain spell. The domain spell must be one of the two to which he has access, either _protection from evil_ or
      _cure light wounds_.
  - name: Spontaneous Casting
    description: >-
      A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the
      cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order
      to cast any _cure_ spell of the same spell level or lower (a _cure_ spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).
      For example, a good cleric who has prepared command (a 1st-level spell) may lose command in order to cast _cure
      light wounds_ (also a 1st-level spell). Clerics of good deities can cast _cure_ spells in this way because they
      are especially proficient at wielding positive energy.


      An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), on the other hand, can’t convert prepared spells to cure
      spells but can convert them to _inflict_ spells (an _inflict_ spell is one with “inflict” in its name).


      A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either _cure_
      spells or _inflict_ spells (player’s choice), depending on whether the cleric is more proficient at wielding
      positive or negative energy. Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines
      whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below). Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of Wee Jas
      (goddess of death and magic) convert prepared spells to _inflict_ spells, not _cure_ spells. All clerics of St.
      Cuthbert (god of retribution) and all nonevil clerics of Obad-Hai (god of nature) convert prepared spells to
      _cure_ spells, not _inflict_ spells.
  - name: Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells
    description: A cleric can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity’s (if he has one). For example,
      a good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) cannot cast evil spells. Spells associated with particular
      alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
  - name: Turn or Rebuke Undead
    type: su
    description: >-
      Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures (such as skeletons, zombies, ghosts,
      and vampires) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol.


      A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric
      (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures., forcing them to
      cower in awe of his power. If your character is a neutral cleric of a neutral deity, you must choose whether his
      turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once you make this choice, it cannot be
      reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous _cure_ or _inflict_ spells (see
      above). Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic) rebuke or command undead.
      All clerics of St. Cuthbert (god of retribution) and all nonevil clerics of Obad-Hai (god of nature) turn of
      destroy undead.


      A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5
      or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: A cleric’s bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic
      evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to
      the character because of his race.
