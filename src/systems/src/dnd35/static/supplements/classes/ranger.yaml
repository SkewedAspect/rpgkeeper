name: Ranger
description: The forests are home to fierce and cunning creatures, such as bloodthirsty owlbears and malicious displacer
  beasts. But more cunning and powerful than these monsters is the ranger, a skilled hunter and stalker. He knows the
  woods as if they were his home (as indeed they are), and he knows his prey in deadly detail.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower
      shields).
  - name: Favored Enemy
    type: ex
    description: >-
      At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table 3–14: Ranger Favored Enemies.
      Due to his extensive study on his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such
      creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these
      skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.


      At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional
      favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored
      enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example, a 5th-level ranger has two
      favored enemies; against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and
      weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he
      gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies.
      Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2.


      If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as
      indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance,
      devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever
      bonus is higher. See the _Monster Manual_ for more information on types of creatures.
  - name: Track
    description: A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.
  - name: Wild Empathy
    type: ex
    description: >-
      A ranger can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear
      or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The
      ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The
      typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.


      To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be
      within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way
      takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.


      The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a
      basilisk or a girallon), but he takes a –4 penalty on the check.
  - name: Combat Style
    type: ex
    description: >-
      At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice
      affects the character’s class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any
      way.


      If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal
      prerequisites for that feat.


      If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not
      have the normal prerequisites for that feat.


      The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his
      combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
  - name: Endurance
    description: A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.
  - name: Animal Companion
    type: ex
    description: >-
      At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog,
      riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the DM’s
      campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the DM may add the following creatures to the
      ranger’s list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that
      accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. (For instance, an aquatic creature can’t
      adventure with a ranger on land and shouldn’t be selected by a nonaquatic character without extenuating
      circumstances). In most cases, the animal companion functions as a mount, sentry, scout, or hunting animal, rather
      than as a protector.


      This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger’s effective druid level is
      one-half his ranger level. For example, the animal companion of a 4th-level ranger would be the equivalent of a
      2nd-level druid’s animal companion. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a
      druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Thus, he must be at least an 8th-level
      ranger to select from the druid’s list of 4th-level animal companions, and if he chooses one of those animals, his
      effective druid level would be reduced by 3, to 1st level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative
      animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.
  - name: Spells
    description: >-
      Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells (the same type of
      spells available to the cleric, druid, and paladin), which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must
      choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).


      To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for
      1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a
      ranger’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger’s Wisdom modifier.


      Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In
      addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table 3–13 indicates that the
      ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level ranger), he
      gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger
      does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.


      A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure
      spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast
      spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.


      Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger
      level.
  - name: Improved Combat Style
    type: ex
    description: >-
      At 6th level, a ranger’s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he
      selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal
      prerequisites for that feat.


      If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting
      feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.


      As before, the benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all
      benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
  - name: Woodland Stride
    type: ex
    description: Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
      overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other
      impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede
      motion still affect him.
  - name: Swift Tracker
    type: ex
    description: Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the
      normal –5 penalty. He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed
      while tracking.
  - name: Evasion
    type: ex
    description: At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a
      successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a
      red dragon’s fiery breath or a _fireball_), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is
      wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the
      benefit of evasion.
  - name: Combat Style Mastery
    type: ex
    description: >-
      At 11th level, a ranger’s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he
      selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have
      the normal prerequisites for that feat.


      If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting
      feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.


      As before, the benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all
      benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
  - name: Camouflage
    type: ex
    description: A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain
      doesn’t grant cover or concealment.
  - name: Hide in Plain Sight
    type: ex
    description: While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while
      being observed.
