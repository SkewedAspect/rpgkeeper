description: Droids do not need to eat, sleep, or breath, and are unaffected by toxins or poisons. Droids have a
  cybernetic implant cap of 6, instead of their brawn rating. In addition, after selecting a career, a Droid Player
  Character may train one rank in six of the eight career skills (instead of the usual four). After selecting their
  first specialization, a Droid Player Character may train one rank in three of the four specialization skills (instead
  of the usual two).
