description: Does not gain the benefits of recovering with a bacta tank, stimpack, or Medicine check. Inorganic
  characters do recover naturally from resting, as their systems attempt self-repairs. Otherwise inorganic characters
  need to be tended with a Mechanics check, using the same difficulties and results of Medicine checks for organic
  beings. Due to their resilient metallic construction droids tart the game with one rank in the Enduring ability.
