name: Slow-Firing
description: Slow-Firing weapons tend to be large, heavy, emplacement-mounted weapons like the turbolasers found on
  capital ships, or planetary defense ion cannons. While they deal incredible damage, they need time to recharge or cool
  down between shots. A weapon’s Slow-Firing rating dictates how quickly the weapon can be fired after an attack. For
  example, a heavy turbolaser with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two Rounds after being fired before it can be fired again.
