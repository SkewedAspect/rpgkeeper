description: >-
  Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. If the attack is successful, the target continues to suffer the weapon’s
  base damage for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating. Damage is applied at the start of each of the
  target’s actions.

  A victim might be able to stop the damage by rolling around on the ground and making an Agility check as an
  Coordination check action. This is an **Average (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Coordination
  check** on hard surfaces such as the hall of a spaceship, or an **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Coordination
  check** on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage immediately. Both situations assume the
  flame is from actual combustion rather than a chemical reaction. With the latter, there is usually little the victim
  can do.
