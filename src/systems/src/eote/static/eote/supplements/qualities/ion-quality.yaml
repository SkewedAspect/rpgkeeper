name: Ion Quality
description: Ion weapons are designed to affect electrical systems as opposed to dealing raw damage. They are fitted to
  ships to knock out opponents’ shields, sensors, and engines. They are shorter range than laser weapons, and deal
  larger amounts of damage, but their damage is dealt to the target as system strain (usually on vehicles). It is still
  reduced by armor and soak. Droids are affected by ion weapons, taking damage to their strain threshold.
