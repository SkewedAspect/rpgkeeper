name: Tractor Quality
description: Instead of firing searing beams of laser fire or crackling ion discharges, this weapon fires relatively
  harmless electromagnetic beams that ensnare ships and hold them fast in space. Tractor beams, like all weapons, are
  fired at their target using a the appropriate skill check (generally Gunnery) with all suitable modifiers. Once the
  weapon hits its target, the target may not move unless its pilot makes a successful Piloting check with a difficulty
  based on the tractor beam’s rating. The tractor beam’s rating is always noted in parentheses in the weapon’s stats
  next to the quality.
