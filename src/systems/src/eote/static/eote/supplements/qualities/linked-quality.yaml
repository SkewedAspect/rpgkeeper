description: >-
  Some weapons, like the laser cannons fitted to the Z-95 Headhunter, are designed to fire together at the same target.
  This increases the possibility of a hit as well as the damage dealt. When firing a linked weapon, on a successful
  attack, the weapon deals one hit.

  The wielder may spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> to gain an additional hit, and may do so a number
  of times equal to the weapon’s linked rating. Additional hits from linked weapons may only be applied against the
  original target. Each hit deals the weapon’s base damage plus total <success></success> scored on the check.
