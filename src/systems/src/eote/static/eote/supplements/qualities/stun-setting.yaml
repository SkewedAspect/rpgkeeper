name: Stun Setting
description: >-
  Some weapons deal Stun damage instead of regular damage. In this case, the weapon deals damage as strain instead of
  wounds. This damage is still reduced by a target’s soak.

  A variant of this is a Stun setting. As a free action, the wielder can choose to switch the setting of his weapon to
  “Stun.” In this case, it does stun damage as described above. When weapons with a stun setting are used to deal stun
  damage, their range changes to short and cannot be increased.
