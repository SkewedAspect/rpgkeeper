name: Pierce Quality
description: An attack made with this weapon ignores one point of soak for each rank of Pierce. If the weapon has more
  ranks of Pierce than the target’s total soak, it completely ignores the target’s soak. For example, Pierce 3 against a
  soak of 2 ignores 2 points of soak, but the extra “point” of Pierce has no further effect.
