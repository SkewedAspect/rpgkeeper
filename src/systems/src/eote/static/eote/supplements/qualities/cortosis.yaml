name: Cortosis
description: >-
  Cortosis is an ore found primarily in the Outer Rim. It is extremely rare and valuable, and was used primarily during
  the Clone Wars against the Jedi knights. There are two varieties of Cortosis ore. The rarest versions can actually
  short out a lightsaber’s blade, causing it to fail temporarily. The far more common Cortosis ore is still a miraculous
  substance, because when molded into armor, it forms an interlocking molecular bond that is extremely resistant to
  energy weapons.

  Weapons with the Cortosis quality are immune to the Sunder quality. Armor with the Cortosis quality makes the wearer’s
  soak immune to the Pierce and Breach qualities.
