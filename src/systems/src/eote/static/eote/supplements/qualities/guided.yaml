description: >-
  Certain types of projectiles may benefit from course alterations after being fired—such as guided missiles. If a
  character misses while firing a Guided weapon and if Guided activates, he may make an attack check at the end of the
  round. The difficulty of the check is calculated by comparing the weapon’s silhouette of 0 to the silhouette of the
  target (see page 235), and the check’s Ability dice equal the weapon’s Guided rating. If the test is successful, the
  weapon strikes the target and damage is dealt normally.

  Guided requires <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> to activate, unless otherwise
  specified in the weapon’s description. Remember, the Guided effect can activate on its subsequent attacks,
  representing the projectile continuing to track the target.

  “Spoofing” is a countermeasure designed to work against the particular projectile—such as flares designed to draw off
  an infrared missile. Spoofing directly increases the defense of the target against attacks with the Guided quality.
