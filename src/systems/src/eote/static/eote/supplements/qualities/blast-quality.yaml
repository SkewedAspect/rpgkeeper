name: Blast Quality
description: >-
  The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or similar area of effect, like the detonation of a grenade or a
  warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is successful and Blast activates, each character (friend or foe)
  Engaged with the original target suffers wounds equal to the weapon’s Blast rating (plus an additional wound per
  Success as usual).

  In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Game Master might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage.

  If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the firer
  (or quick reactions on the part of the victims) means the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. However,
  the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses, by spending
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage>. In this case, the original target and every
  target engaged with the original target suffers damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.
