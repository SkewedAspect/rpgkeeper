name: Limited Ammo
description: Some weapons fire particularly large or complex projectiles that cost significant amounts of credits, or
  are themselves a complete weapon that once launched is expended. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality may be used to
  make a number of attacks equal to its Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with a maneuver. In addition,
  each shot expends one of a limited number of rounds of ammo, which must be purchased or otherwise obtained before the
  weapon can be used. This also applies to grenades and other “one use” weapons which have the Limited Ammo 1 quality
  (here, the user is not “reloading” the grenade, but drawing another to use—but mechanically they are equivalent).
