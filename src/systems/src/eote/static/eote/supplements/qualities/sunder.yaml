name: Sunder
description: >-
  When activated, the attacker chooses one item openly wielded by the target (such as a weapon, shield, or item on a
  belt). That item is damaged one step: to Minor if undamaged, from Minor to Moderate, or from Moderate to Major. If a
  weapon already suffering Major damage is the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed.

  Sunder requires <advantage></advantage> to activate. If activated multiple times in the same attack, each can be
  applied against the same weapon, potentially taking a weapon from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack.
