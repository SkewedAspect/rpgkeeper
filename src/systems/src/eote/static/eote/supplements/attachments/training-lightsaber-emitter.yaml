name: Training Lightsaber Emitter
description: In the days of the Republic, the Jedi allowed their younglings to train with "training sabers," non-lethal versions of their famous energy blades. A training lightsaber is almost the same as a standard lightsaber; however, the crystal is replaced with a training emitter. The training emitter creates a blade that is completely non-lethal, and at most can generate a stun shock. A training emitter is a lightsaber crystal.
