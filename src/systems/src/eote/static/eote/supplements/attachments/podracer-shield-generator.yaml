name: Podracer Shield Generator
description: |-
  Most Podracers, whether custom-built racers or one of the many factory customs, mount a small, low-output shield generator in the cockpit. These shield generators are thin and cover primarily the very front. They only protect the driver, and only from exhaust wash from the engines and from debris kicked up from the track surface or flung at the racer by spectators (or other racers). They provide no protection to to the vehicle itself and are generally worthless in the event of a crash or other catastrophic event.
  Some racers, though, value personal safety over tradition, running powerful, full-spectrum shield generators that protect the entire vehicle. These are usually built specifically for Podracing and are tuned for the kinds of environments typically found on Podrace courses. Racing teams that are too poor or too old-fashioned to use factory-built generators still use salvaged units pulled from wrecked starfighters or emplacement shield generators.
