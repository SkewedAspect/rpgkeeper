name: Clone Polarized Electrobinoculars
description: Some clone troopers mount a pair of electrobinoculars to their helmet on a visor. These can be quickly lowered to the helmet's viewport to observe a distant target. The standard set of polarized electrobinoculars includes light filtering as well as image sharpening and stabilization. The Grand Army of the Republic-issue are battle hardened and every bit as durable as the other components of clone trooper armor.
