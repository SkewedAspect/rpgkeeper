name: Advanced Targeting Array
description: The Sureshot Advanced Targeting Array by Taim Bak is a good example of a targeting computer, using sophisticated holo-imaging to present a pilot or gunner a detailed, three-dimensional view of his target. Installation of the ATA increases the accuracy of a ship's weapons, and allows gunners to get more shots on target, increasing their effectiveness in combat. This may be applied to all starships and vehicles.
