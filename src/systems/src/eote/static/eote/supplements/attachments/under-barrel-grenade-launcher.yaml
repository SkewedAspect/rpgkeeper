name: Under-Barrel Grenade Launcher
description: Under-barrel grenade launchers are designed to give soldiers or squads heavy anti-infantry or light anti-vehicle capabilities in a small package. This attachment consists of a basic, smooth-bore barrel attached to a magazine with an automatic feed system. It carries up to six grenades and is fired by a simple press of a button. It adds extra weight to the weapon it's mounted to, however, which makes the entire assembly quite barrel heavy. This attachment can only be applied to rifle-sized weapons (Ranged (Heavy) weapons).
