name: Dragite Gem
description: Small, dull, and brittle, Dragite gems are found in the caves and caverns of the D'olop mountain range on
  M'haeli, an agriworld in the Expansion Region. In their natural state, dragite crystals are one of the most brittle
  kyber crystals, and they produce a loud ringing when struck. Worked into a suitable lightsaber crystal, a difficult
  task due to the dragite gem's distressing tendency to fracture or shatter easily, it produces a blade that pulses and
  hums loudly. In addition to this noise, when a lightsaber equipped with a dragite gem strikes a solid target, it
  produces a deafening crack and a shock wave that can disorient and even cause bodily harm to its target. A dragite gem
  is a lightsaber crystal.
