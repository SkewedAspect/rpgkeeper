name: Pressurized Gas Cartridge
description: While a spray injector does not typically expel its contents with sufficient force to inflict serious harm,
  there is no particular reason it cannot do so if a tinkerer is willing to change out the factory-standard gas
  cartridge for one with a bit more kick. Needless to say, making such an alteration voids the multi-goo gun's warranty.
