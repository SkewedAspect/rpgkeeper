  Lasan Chronicles Bonuses
  Life since the fall of the Republic has grown difficult for the Lasat. The Empire exterminated them in droves, a gruesome example to those who seek to rebel. Many Lasat now search for meaning in an existence that seems to only want them destroyed. Many turn to their species’ most ancient teachings in hopes of finding some parallels, some guidance for a people adrift. One of the most frequent resources for this study has been the Chronicles of the Three. This collection of ancient parables follows the three Lasan mythic archetypes: the Child, the Fool, and the Warrior.
  When a character studies the Chronicles, they may use Perception, Knowledge (Lore), or Discipline to decipher it. They must then spend an hour studying the Chronicles, succeeding at a **Hard (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) check** of the appropriate skill at the end of it. Depending on their chosen skill, they receive a unique bonus that can be used once during the remainder of the session. Knowledge (Lore) grants the Perspicacity of the Child, whose desire to learn outstrips all else. The character may add <boost></boost> to any one Knowledge skill check they make. Perception gives them the Insight of the Fool: in knowing nothing, they see everything. Once, when making a combat skill check, they may re-roll one <ability></ability> of their choice. Using Discipline leaves them with the Purpose of the Warrior, whose devotion and aim overcomes all obstacles. They may re-roll one <setback></setback> on a single skill check they make.
