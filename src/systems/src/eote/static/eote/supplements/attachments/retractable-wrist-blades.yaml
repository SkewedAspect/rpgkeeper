name: Retractable Wrist Blades
description: Knives are among the most universally developed and broadly useful tools. While its combat function is
  obvious, knives are also routinely used for modifying equipment, as makeshift prybars, for escaping restraints, and
  for countless other applications. Not surprisingly, many warriors like to have a blade readily at hand. Mounting
  retractable blades on one or both forearms of an armored suit provides a solution that is immediately available. In
  some cases, the mount point is further reinforced, transforming the forearm blade mount into a small buckler.
