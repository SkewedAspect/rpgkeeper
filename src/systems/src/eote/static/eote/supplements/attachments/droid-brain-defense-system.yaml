name: Droid Brain Defense System
description: An extremely unusual upgrade generally reserved for powered armor suits, a droid brain defense system uses
  a full sensor suite to alert wearers to and help them avoid threats. The most basic models simply warn the user of
  threats and indicate ideal cover positions through a haptic interface or by voice. More advanced models incorporate a
  system of complex motors or even repulsor generators throughout the armor to literally throw the wearer out of the way
  of incoming fire. These droids often develop highly paranoid personalities, and their earnest attempts to protect
  their master even outside of combat can prove highly inconvenient.
