name: Proximity Detonator
description: "Although certain models of mines include proximity detonators as standard, some desire this feature for grenades and other explosive devices. A proximity detonator adds an alternative trigger method: rather than detonating via a timer or on impact, the grenade only detonates when it detects the movement of a being or creature nearby. With the addition of a proximity detonator, a simple frag grenade becomes a deadly trap. A well-placed concussion grenade can incapacitate an entire squad of pursuing stormtroopers, giving Rebels better chances for escape. This weapon attachment can be applied to any grenade or explosive device."
