name: Reflec Shadowskin
description: An advanced, light-absorbing polymer that can be applied to armor, reflec shadowskin coating can enhance
  the stealth abilities of its wearer - anyone wearing armor covered in this substance can easily blend into the
  shadows. While this coating does not make the wearer invisible, it does mean that observers who only catch a glimpse
  are far less likely to register what they saw or believe it to be anything more than a trick of the light. This
  attachment can only be applied to armor with a soak of 2 or lower.
