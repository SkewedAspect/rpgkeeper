name: Hunting Barrel
description: Designed to increase range and accuracy, a hunting barrel can turn any blaster rifle into a dedicated
  hunting weapon. This two-meter-long replacement barrel is constructed of lightweight materials and packed with
  upgraded pulse adapters and denser, more aggressive galven circuitry. The increased accuracy and range come at the
  cost of the base weapon's weight and size, however. The extra-long barrel makes the weapon awkward to handle and fire
  without proper support, as well as making it almost impossible to conceal. A hunting barrel can only be used on a
  blaster rifle.
