name: Vaksai Modification Package
description: A prefabricated kit of starship modifications sold by TransGalMeg for their Kihraxz modular light
  starfighter, this package includes upgraded engines and flight control systems, a heavier weapons loadout, and a
  higher-out-put shield generator. While expensive, those Kihraxz pilots who can afford it swear by the added
  survivability and firepower it provides, allowing the fighter to engage heavier targets and emerge victorious.
