name: XCiter Overcharge
description: A common—and dangerous—modification among espionage agents, an XCiter Overcharge allows an individual to
  empty a blaster's energy cell in a single, extremely powerful shot. This increases the output for an emergency kick,
  but it runs the risk of destroying the weapon and harming the user. While typically applied to holdout blasters, this
  attachment can be applied to any personal blaster weapon.

baseModifier: As an incidental, shooters may overcharge the XCiter on their blaster. This gives the weapon to Prepare 1
  item quality and increases the damage on the next attack by 4. Once it is fired the weapon runs out of ammo and must
  be recharged.; GMs may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> from any
  combat check involving an overcharged shot with this weapon to cause the weapon to explode and deal full damage to the
  shooter.
