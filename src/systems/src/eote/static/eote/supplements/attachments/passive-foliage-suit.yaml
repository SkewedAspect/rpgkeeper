name: Passive Foliage Suit
description: For those operating in the wilds, sometimes the simplest camouflage methods are the best. Given this, it's
  not surprising that hunters and other individuals who spend a lot of time in the wilderness often use passive foliage
  suits. These suits have patches of synthetic greenery designed to mimic natural flora. Clusters of open tie-lines also
  allow wearers to easily attach local foliage to the suit, allowing them to alter their camouflage when the
  surroundings change. This attachment can be applied to any armor that could logically integrate the necessary patches
  and tie-lines.
