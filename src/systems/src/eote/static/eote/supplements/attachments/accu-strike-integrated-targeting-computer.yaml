name: '"Accu-Strike" Integrated Targeting Computer'
description: Complex and sophisticated attachments, targeting systems integrate an advanced targeting computer and
  sensor suite, providing a constant stream of data to the user. Depending on the model, this information may be
  delivered by audio or on a visor HUD. Some particularly advanced systems incorporate small vibro-motors installed in
  the armor's gloves or gauntlets and wired to the helmet system, which subtly adjust the user's hands to enhance
  accuracy.
