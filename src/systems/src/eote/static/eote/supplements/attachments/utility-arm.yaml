name: Utility Arm
description: For some species, it's a mystery how humans and their ilk get by with only two arms. In fact, it's often said that the first armor-mounted utility arm was invented by a Dug Engineer, although another tale attributes its origin to a cybernetics manufacturer with a product surplus. Regardless of its origin, the utility arm is now a common tool for Engineers and technicians of all species. Mounted on a harness or suit of combat armor, a utility arm is a mechanical appendage similar in function to many cybernetic and droid arms and ending in a manipulating "hand." Although utility arms are most often used to increase workshop productivity, combatants of all kinds have found them useful on the battlefield.
