name: Gunnery Droid Brain
description: Much more than a simple targeting computer, a specialized droid brain can be installed on a ship to operate
  its weapons indepedently or assist a sentient gunner. Although GoCorp's CD-14c model continues to prove popular with
  Technicians who want their ship to defend itself when necessary, some users complain of the droid's overly hostile
  antagonistic behaviour. GoCorp continues to deny rumours of so-called "unanticipated activations". This attachment can
  be applied to any vehicle or starship.
