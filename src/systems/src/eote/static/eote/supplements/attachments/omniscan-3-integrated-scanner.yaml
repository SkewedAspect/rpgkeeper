name: OmniScan 3 Integrated Scanner
description: Warriors must be aware of their surroundings at all times, and ready to respond to any threat. Because a hand-held scanner both requires the user to direct his attention to it and restricts his weapon use, it is common for military forces to integrate scanner systems into helmets. As usual, many Hired Guns follow suit, particularly those with a military background. Most integrated scanner systems utilize a heads-up display, projected on the inside of the helmet's visor. Some systems include a retractable mono-visor that extends only while the scanner is in use.
