name: Enhanced Hyperspace Shields
description: Few things are more dangerous to a ship than colliding with a mass shadow in hyperspace. Although all ships
  are equipped with sensors intended to detect a mass shadow and automatically drop the ship out of hyperspace, such
  systems are not infallible. As an added level of protection, some engineers modify a vessel with  enhanced particle
  shields designed to potentially save a ship from complete destruction in a case of a hyperspace collision. Many
  captains consider the drain on ship resources and the cost to be too great for additional protection against such a
  rare event, but these systems save lives. This attachment can be applied to any ship with a hyperdrive.
