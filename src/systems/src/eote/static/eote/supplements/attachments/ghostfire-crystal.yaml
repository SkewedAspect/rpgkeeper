name: Ghostfire Crystal
description: These kyber crystals grow in nearly invisible formations on a handful of far flung Outer Rim worlds. Their
  precarious spires of entirely transparent stones rise from rocky foundations. They are typically found at the peaks of
  mountains, when they can be located at all. Finders can use ghostfire crystals to construct a lightsaber with a blade
  as difficult to detect as the spire from which they harvested the crystal. Lightsabers with ghostfire crystals at
  their core produce no sound whatsoever, and the blades are dim and translucent compared to the incandescent fire of
  the other lightsabers. most curious of all are the illusory afterimages of the blades that follow the wielders'
  motions, disorienting foes and disguising the true position of their blades.
