name: Marksman Barrel
description: Merr-Sonn's KX765 Marksman Barrel was designed to meet the needs of the finger for whom long-range accuracy is a necessity. Popular among bounty hunters and assassins, this barrel is nearly two meters long and made of lightweight materials. It features upgraded static pulse adapters as well as a denser galven circuitry pattern that not only increases the weapon's range, but also its accuracy. The trade-off for this increased range and accuracy is a weapon that's slightly awkward to use and nearly impossible to conceal due to the length of the barrel. This modification may only be applied to blaster rifles.
