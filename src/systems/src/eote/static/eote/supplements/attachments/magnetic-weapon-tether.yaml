name: Magnetic Weapon Tether
description: A magnetic weapon tether is a relatively simple modification that consists of a small magnetic device built
  into the weapon. The magnetic weapon tether allows the wielder to snap the weapon back to a readied position with a
  press of a button, rather than having to scramble to retrieve it. While many Force users might scoff at this ability -
  after all, why use a device for what they can do with the force anyway - others prefer to have the extra layer or
  safety, or wish to avoid using their Force powers openly in places where the Empire's presence is strong. This
  attachment can be applied to any weapon wielded in one hand that could logically benefit from a weapon tether.
