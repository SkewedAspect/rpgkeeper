  Part of the thrill of Podracing is the near certainty of collisions, for many enthusiasts, a good race is measured by
  how many crashes occurred, not how fast the winner ran the circuit. Given the nature of these races, many pilots view
  it as foregone that they will be involved in collisions, no matter what effort they might take to avoid them. This
  leads to some adopting reinforced plating for their engines, the better to withstand "accidental" impacts as they
  occur during a race.

  More tactically-minded pilots take this even further adding ridges, struts, and vanes designed to appear ornamental or
  to a aid in aerodynamics, but instead intended to cushion impacts when their vehicle rams into another. That those
  pilots who are frequently involved in collisions and still manage to cheat death race after race, garner large amounts
  of fame (and credits) certainly has a strong bearing on other pilots decision to adopt such modifications and alter
  their racing tactics accordingly.
