description: The demands put on a ship or vehicle's electrical system, both by the systems connected to it and by daily wear-and-tear, are enormous. Anything that draws power from a ship or vehicle's reactor, from the pilot's datapad charger to the onboard weapon systems, puts strain on every cable, every breaker, every bus plate between the system and the power source. Hardened circuits covers a variety of electrical transmission gear that, when installed, improve a vehicle or ship's power system and allow it to handle heavier-than-normal power loads.
