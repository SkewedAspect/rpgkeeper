name: Poison Reservoir
description: Many assassins who use melee weapons choose to improve the lethality of their blades by adding a poison
  reservoir that releases a toxin through a channel in the blade at the push of a button in the hilt. While dipping a
  weapon in poison can be somewhat effective, a reservoir is a much more efficient delivery method. This attachment can
  only be used with Brawl and Melee weapons.
