name: Tracking System
description: Through a series of specialized computer systems and sensors, this attachment collects and processes data from the wearer's surroundings to follow and predict the movements of designated targets. A heads-up display integrated into a helmet or visor feeds the wearer this information onto an overly of their surroundings. The systems are not limited to local targets, either, but can follow signals from distant communicators or tags and process optimal routes towards them. Tracking systems in armor are typically designed to operate alongside similar equipment, and are often able to integrate with other systems to a greater effect than the sum of their parts. This attachment can be installed on any armor.
