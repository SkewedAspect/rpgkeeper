name: Physiological Enhancement System
description: |-
  These advanced, custom-tailored systems provide medical diagnostics, ergonomic adjustments, and powered support systems tuned to the wearer’s motor functions. Stress and pain are greatly reduced by heart-rate regulation and temperature-control systems, and common physical tasks require considerably less effort. These benefits come at a significant cost, as the systems involved require careful calibration to the wearer’s specific needs and physique.
  Although physiological support systems are normally tailored to individual physiology, they can be produced for clones using a standardized template, greatly reducing the cost. As such, the first cost listed is for clones, while the second, higher price is for a custom support system. This attachment may only be installed on fully enclosed suits of armor, such as laminate, clone trooper, or heavy battle armor.
