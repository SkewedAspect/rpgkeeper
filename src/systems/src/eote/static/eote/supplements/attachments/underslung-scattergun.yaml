name: Underslung Scattergun
description: An ungainly attachment, an underslung scattergun is a single-shot slugthrower that can be attached to another weapon. While hardly what one would call subtle, it nonetheless has found a ready market amongst some bounty hunters and gunslingers due to its low cost and impressive effect. This attachment can only applied to pistol and rifle-sized weapons.
