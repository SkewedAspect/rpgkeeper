description: Over the millennia, tinkerers, weapon designers, and desperate fighters have come up with countless
  delivery systems for explosives, from missile tubes to combat droids. One less-popular approach that nonetheless
  endures among certain demolitions experts is the use of a modified grenade or detonite charge capable of
  self-propulsion. Such modifications are almost always unique, although certain small droids and other devices are a
  popular basis, despite manufacturer warnings. From a proton grenade with wheels to a hovering thermal detonator, these
  makeshift devices-when successful-allow unparalleled control of an explosive device from a considerable distance. This
  is generally achieved via a small holocam and remote-control unit, although the addition of a droid brain detonator
  can be exceedingly effective. This weapon attachment can be applied to any grenade or explosive device with an
  encumbrance value of 3 or less.
