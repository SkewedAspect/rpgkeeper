name: H9 Pistol Grip
description: A pistol grip replaces the stock or other grip on a long arm with one like that of a pistol, allowing it to be fired one-handed. Most blaster rifles feature a pistol-like grip by default, in which case this attachment makes additional modifications to make the weapon better-suited to one-handed use. This attachment can be used with any Ranged (Heavy) blaster rifle, blaster carbine, or slugthrower that does not possess the Cumbersome quality.
