name: Removed Safety Features
description: By removing or deactivating weapon safeties and other features a gun can more easily be drawn and readied for combat. Of course, these safety features are in place for a reason, and weapons modified in such a way tend to be more accident prone. This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon that could logically have such elements to remove.
