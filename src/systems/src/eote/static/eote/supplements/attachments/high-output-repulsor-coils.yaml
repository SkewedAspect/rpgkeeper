name: High-Output Repulsor Coils
description: Basic Podracer cockpits come equipped with low-output repulsor coils of the kind typically found on
  repulsorsleds and speeder trucks. Considered a secondary system at best, and really only equipped to keep the Podracer
  at altitude when standing still or at low speeds, a racer's repulsor coils are rarely given a second thought. Savvy
  racers, or veterans with years of racing and building experience under their belts, know that a good repulsorlift
  engine can often mean the difference between first and last place, or finishing or crashing. Upgraded repulsor coils
  increase a Podracer's maximum altitude, allowing it to clear obstacles more easily and even hop over lower flying
  opponents.
