description: Although standard "off-the-shelf" armor can provide invaluable protection, it can also prove bulky or awkward, even after adjustments. For those who require their armor to feel like a second skin, personalized customization can make a drastic difference. Such  work requires a skilled armorer, but it can make body armor a much more enticing option for some. This attachment can be applied to any armor.
