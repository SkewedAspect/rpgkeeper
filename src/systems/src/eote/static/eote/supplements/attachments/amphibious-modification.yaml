name: Amphibious Modification
description: Most starships, speeders and other vehicles not specifically designed for it are unfit for usage underwater. Starships are typically not hydrodynamic, and hills designed for zero gravity and atmospheric use can suffer damage from deep-sea pressure. However, with the addition of turbines, modifications to the engines and reinforcement of the structure  almost any vehicle can be made seaworthy. This attachment can be applied to any vehicle or starship that can enter an atmosphere.
