name: Dart Gun
description: This is a simple device that uses springs or compressed air to fire a tiny alloy dart. While they do very little damage, these darts can be coated with a number of exotic substances, from sedatives to extremely lethal toxins. Dart guns are often concealed in comlinks, glow rods, cigarras, and other cylindrical items, but they can be used anywhere for both offensive and defensive purposes.
