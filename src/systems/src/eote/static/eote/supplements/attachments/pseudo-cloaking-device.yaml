name: Pseudo-Cloaking Device
description: While true cloaking devices are all but unheard of and limited to capital ships, so-called "pseudo-cloaks" incorporate an array of electronic masking devices and countermeasures to render a ship almost invisible to sensors. However, such devices have no visual effect, limiting their usefulness in close-range engagements. This attachment can be applied to any vehicle or starship.
