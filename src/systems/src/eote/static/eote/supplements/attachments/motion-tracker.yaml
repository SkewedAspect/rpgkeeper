name: Motion Tracker
description: The sophisticated device incorporates a full suite of onboard sensors and computers to track and predict the motion of a target, then feed that data back to the user through a variety of means, including a helmet HUD, a hardwired feed  jacked directly into the brain, or other methods. The system might involve motive-actuators within the weapon to subtly adjust aim, or it might interface with motorized gloves. This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Heavy) weapon.
