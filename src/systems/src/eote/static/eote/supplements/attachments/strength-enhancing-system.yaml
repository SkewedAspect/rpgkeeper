name: Strength Enhancing System
description: Strength enhancing systems easily converts a suit of full armor into a power-assisted suit. Composed of a
  matrix of electrically controlled myomer synthetic muscle fibers backed up with nano-hydraulics, the MSES increases a
  wearer's raw physical strength, allowing him to lift more and carry more for longer periods of time. This attachment
  can only be used with laminate armor or similar full-body hard armor suits.
