name: VX Hands-Free Weapon
description: >-
  By modifying his armor to mount one or more weapons, a spacer can keep his hands free for whatever unexpected needs
  might arise in combat—or just to carry more weapons. While few weapons are intended for such use, most can be modified
  to mount on a properly-equipped suit of armor. The difficult part is modifying the weapon so that it can be aimed and
  fired hands-free. Methods range from voice-activation to a pressure-sensitive glove activated by certain hand
  movements to a direct neural link. Such systems almost always incorporate a sophisticated targeting computer or
  retinal tracking mechanism. The most common location for the weapon mount is on the shoulder, though other areas are
  possible.

  A weapon must also be modified in order to be armor-mounted, requiring one hard point. This attachment can mount any
  Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon with an Encumbrance of 4 or less, subject to the GM's discretion.
