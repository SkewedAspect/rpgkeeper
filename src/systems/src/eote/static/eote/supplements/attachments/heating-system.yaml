name: Heating System
description: Like thermal shielding, cold shielding is installed in armor to protect the wearer against dangerously low
  temperatures and frigid environments. Equipped with small, efficient heating elements and double-insulated against the
  cold, this attachment allows a wearer to survive in places where the ambient temperature can be dozens of degrees
  below freezing. Perhaps the most famous type of cold shielding is that built into the custom laminate armor worn by
  the Imperial Army's snowtroopers. This attachment can be installed on any armor that covers the entire body and can be
  sealed.
