description: >-
  Podracer engines come in three varieties rocket motors, turbine engines, and high-performance ion engines. In the
  early days of Podracing, engines were salvaged and rebuilt by talented amateurs. Single-stage heavy lift rockets, ion
  engines from crashed starfighters, air breathing turbojets from performance airspeeders, and even more exotic engine
  types were hauled out of scrapyards or dug out of old military depots and put to use on the racing circuits. Today
  most Podracer engines are either hand-built custom jobs built by big racing teams to their own exact specifications or
  mass produced engines from one of the major manufacturers. No matter their provenance, they are all too big, too fast
  and too loud for civilized racing, which is what makes them so appealing for Podracers.

  Podracer engines must be installed in matched sets usually in multiples of two. Doing otherwise makes for a poorly
  balanced, finicky, unreliable Podracer that is  by its mismatched nature, even more dangerous than usual.
