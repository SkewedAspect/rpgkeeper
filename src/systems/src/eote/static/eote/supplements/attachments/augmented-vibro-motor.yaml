name: Augmented Vibro-Motor
description: |-
  The cutting edge of a vibro weapon's blade is made many times more dangerous than that of a standard blade by the power of the weapon's rapid vibro-motor, which turns the wielder's slightest motion into a powerful and potentioally lethal stroke. Naturally, those who favor such weapons often look to the vibro-motor first when modifying their weapon. Enhancing the output of a vibro weapon's motor can make the weapon even more powerful, capable of shearing through armored plating with ease-provided the wielder can control the weapon's more active motions.
  This attachment can be installed on any vibro weapon.
