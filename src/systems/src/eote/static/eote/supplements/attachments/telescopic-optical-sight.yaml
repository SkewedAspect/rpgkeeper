name: Telescopic Optical Sight
description: Popular with marksmen and snipers, this attachment consists of a long tube attached to the top of a weapon with a number of precisely ground lens elements protected by an impact-resistant housing. The resulting scope magnifies distant images for long-range shooting. This attachment can be used on any ranged weapon (with the exception of one-use weapons like grenades, or weapons like flame projectors that would not realistically benefit from a sight).
