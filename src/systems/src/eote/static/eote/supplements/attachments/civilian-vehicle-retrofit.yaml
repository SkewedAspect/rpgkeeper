name: Civilian Vehicle Retrofit
description: >-
  Most civilian vehicles are not designed for heavy modification. However, dedicated engineers can typically find a
  workaround, sacrificing effectiveness in one area to add capabilities in another.

  When retrofitting a civilian vehicle, a character may spend 500 credits and make a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check** to add a single hard
  point. Hard points added this way should be focused towards military use, and the GM has final say on how this
  retrofit is done and its purpose, as well as which vehicles are applicable for the work.

  For each hard point added this way, though, one of the vehicles other capabilities also degrades. These degradations
  reflect the vehicle's systems being pushed well past their inbuilt tolerances. The GM may come up with a custom effect
  to reflect this limit breaking, or may choose one from five options provided.

  _Note: This attachment contains several custom effects that degrade the vehicle's performance. These are included as
  optional mods. Talk with your GM about which degradation to choose for your vehicle._
