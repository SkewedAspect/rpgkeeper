name: Security Measures
description: There are few things to befall a ship owner more dreaded than to have a craft disappear from an unsecured landing pad. Even aside from the threat of theft, there are many reasons why a crew might want to keep uninvited guests off their ship while it's unattended - especially for any crew engaged in less-than-legal pursuits. Upgraded mag-locks, decoy control panels, reinforced hatches and enhanced security protocols can ensure that a ship goes undisturbed while at port. This attachment can be applied to any vehicle or starship.
