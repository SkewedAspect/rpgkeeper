name: Stripped Down
description: By removing redundant components and stripping down the body, it is possible to significantly reduce the weight and profile of a blaster or other weapon. A weapon modified this way is more easily carried and transported and can be better hidden under a coat or among other equipment. The attachment can be used with any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon.
