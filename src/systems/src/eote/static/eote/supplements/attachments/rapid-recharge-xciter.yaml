name: Rapid-Recharge XCiter
description: Specifically modified gas conversion enablers can allow a blaster pistol or rifle to achieve much higher
  rates of fire than those of a true repeating blaster. Along with modifying or replacing the XCiter, and potentially
  the blaster actuating module. Technicians making heavy modifications to a blaster also often modify the trigger to
  allow for fully automatic fire when the user keeps it depressed. Such high rates of fire mean a considerable loss in
  accuracy. Nevertheless, the advantages offered by a rapid-fire weapon outweigh these drawbacks for some users. This
  attachment can be applied to any blaster.
