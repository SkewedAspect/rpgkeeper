name: Blaster Actuating Module
description: A Blaster Actuating Module is a blaster modification popular with mercenaries, bounty hunters, and anyone
  needing to make the first strike count. Adaptable to nearly any blaster pistol, this attachment is a simple upgraded
  blaster actuating module with custom firmware and a stronger electromagnetic accelerator that provides more powerful
  and more penetrating blaster shots. Unfortunately, this excess power takes its toll on the weapon, and blasters so
  modified tend to develop reliability problems the longer they are used with this attachment. This attachment is only
  for use on Ranged (Light) blaster pistols.
