name: Advanced Subspace Encryption Array
description: The Empire's tight grip on the HoloNet forces the Rebellion to rely primarily on subspace transceivers for communications. However. subspace transceivers have a much more limited range than HoloNet transmissions, requiring frequent relays across additional networks before reaching the intended recipient. Risk of interception of a relayed transmission limits Rebel operations, forcing them to rely on courier ships and secret comm stations for long-range communication. However, ships with advanced encryption algorithms can send coded transmissions that blend with normal traffic, rendering them nearly undetectable and all but indecipherable even if they are intercepted.
