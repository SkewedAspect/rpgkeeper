name: Spread Barrel
description: Commonly applied to blaster rifles and carbines, BlasTech's "Scattergun" Spread Barrel is a common
  modification among spacers and fringers. Designed with close-quarters combat in mind, this attachment replaces a
  blaster's stock barrel with one shorter, bulkier, broader, and equipped with a built-in flash hider. Using a stepped
  array of prismatic crystals located at the end of the barrel as well as a reconfigured galven pattern, this barrel
  splits the blaster's beam into a number of smaller beams that exit the barrel in a spray pattern. Used in a tightly
  packed space, these beams can strike multiple targets with one pull of the trigger. The trade-off for this, however,
  is a reduction in the weapon's range. This attachment can only be applied to blaster rifles and blaster carbines.
