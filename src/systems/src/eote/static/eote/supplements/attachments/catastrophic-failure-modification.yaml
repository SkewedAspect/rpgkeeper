name: Catastrophic Failure Modification
description: Despite their deadliness, lightsabers are famously reliable for a trained user. However, it is possible for
  an expert in lightsaber construction to bypass the weapon's normal safeguards in order to overload it, such as by
  inverting the emitter matrix, releasing a massive amount of plasma energy. For a Jedi to even consider this course of
  action, the situation must be truly dire.
useWith: weapon
hpRequired: 0
rarity: 0
baseModifier: When lightsaber is activated, it overloads, causing it to detonate at the end of the following round,
  dealing 20 damage with Breach 1 and Vicious 4, to all characters and objects within short range. The lightsaber, but
  not the crystal, is destroyed in the processes.
