name: Enhanced XCiter
description: |-
  Outlaw Techs have long known how to modify the gas
  conversion enabler in a blaster to yield a more highly
  energetic—and correspondingly more destructive—payload. Such modified XCiter modules are highly
  unstable, however, and are sometimes disparaged as
  being just as dangerous to the wielder and anyone
  else nearby as to the enemy. Despite the risk and the
  illegality of the modification, many outlaws seek out
  such customizations to gain an edge in a firefight. This
  attachment can be applied to any blaster.
