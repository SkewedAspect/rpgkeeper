description: Lorrdian gemstones arc kyber crystals mined millen nia ago by enslaved Lorrdians during the Kanz Disorders.
  Created by Force-sensitive Lorrdians to supplement the intricate kinetic communication developed among the slave
  populace, these gemstones were imbued with Force energies that allowed their possessors to read the emotions and
  actions of others. When installed in a lightsaber, a Lorrdian gemstone allows the wielder to predict the actions of an
  opponent, giving the wielder a decided edge in melee combat. A Lorrdian gemstone is a lightsaber crystal.
