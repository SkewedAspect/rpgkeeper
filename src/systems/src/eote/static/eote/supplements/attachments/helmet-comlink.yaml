name: Helmet Comlink
description: Rather than rely on a separate piece of equipment that can be broken, lost, or stolen, some mercenaries and bounty hunters prefer to install a micro comlink directly into their armor. A micro-comlink can comprise anything from a complete in-helmet system to a simple small microphone and speaker attached to a wristplate or near the shoulder. A micro-comlink can be installed in any armor.
