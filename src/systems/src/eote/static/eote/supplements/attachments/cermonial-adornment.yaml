name: Cermonial Adornment
description: >-
  Diplomats and their retinues typically avoid armor and weapons, the better to clearly signal their sincerity. However,
  at times, even diplomacy is dangerous enough to warrant looking into personal protection. Those who seek a compromise
  between protecting their lives and putting others at easy sometimes don ornamented armor with a ceremonial style that
  downplays its combat-oriented nature. The best armor of this type is as functional as it is beautiful, but usually
  brings an attendant cost in mobility due to the elaborate decorations over the protective wear.

  This attachment may be installed on any armor, although the GM may alter its effects for particularly intimidating or
  heavy armor.
