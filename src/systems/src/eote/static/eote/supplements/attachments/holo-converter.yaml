name: Holo Converter
description: Holo converters are common holo scrambling devices that allow users to alter a holoprojector's outgoing
  signal. Using powerful alteration technologies, holo converters allow users to change their species, age, gender, and
  any other identifying features on camera to hide their identity. This can be used with any holographic
  recording/projecting device, and the converter can store four different alter egos in its database.
