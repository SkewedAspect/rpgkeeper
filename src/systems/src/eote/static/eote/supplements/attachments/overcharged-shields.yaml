name: Overcharged Shields
description: Most shield arrays have the potential to generate a stronger field. However, this has the potential to damage the array itself, leaving the ship with no protection. Despite the risks. some shipboard engineers modify the shields to allow for increased output with only a few moments' tinkering in the midst of combat, banking on the extra defense to allow them to escape or defeat the enemy before suffering the repercussions.
