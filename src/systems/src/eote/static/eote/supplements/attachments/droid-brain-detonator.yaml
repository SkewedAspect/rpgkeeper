name: Droid Brain Detonator
description: >-
  Weapons manufacturers, combat engineers, and sabotage specialists are constantly inventing new triggers and detonators
  for explosive devices of all kinds, in order to provide for every conceivable situation. One of the most sophisticated
  and uncommon triggers makes use of an actual droid brain. Whereas timers, proximity detectors, and other common
  detonators are all effective within their narrow parameters, a droid brain is adaptable for nearly any situation or
  plan. A droid brain is able to abide by extremely specific trigger conditions and to follow complex instructions. For
  instance, users might instruct a detonite charge to wait thirty minutes after several specific individuals have
  entered a facility before igniting, or tell their frag grenade to avenge them should they fall in battle.

  Droid brain detonators are intensely loyal, even by droid standards, but they tend to develop distinct personality
  quirks over their relatively short existences. Some are annoyingly chipper and enthusiastic, perhaps owing to
  additional layers of obedience programming, while others exhibit anything from childlike naivete to nihilistic
  moroseness. This attachment can be applied to any grenade or explosive device.
