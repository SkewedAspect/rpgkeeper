description: Podracer handling upgrades encompass a wide array of systems and technologies designed to make Podracers
  easier to pilot. These upgrades can be tiny, variable pitch jets and movable repulsor fields to brute force
  counterweights that slide into special compartments to counteract inertia. While such upgrades do increase a
  Podracer's handling capabilities, no amount of modification is likely to likely to make the exceedingly fast and
  fragile race vehicle easy enough to handle for a human pilot.
