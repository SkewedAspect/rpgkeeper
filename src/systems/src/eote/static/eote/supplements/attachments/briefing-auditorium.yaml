name: Briefing Auditorium
description: |-
  Most dedicated warships, especially those in service
  with the Imperial Navy, have special compartments set
  aside for the briefing and debriefing of fighter, gunboat,
  and shuttle pilots, ground vehicle drivers, and ground
  combat forces. Before and after missions, pilots, soldiers,
  and support staff gather in these large, well-lit
  compartments to be briefed on their missions by a
  senior officer, or to report on their missions and learn
  how their success or failure affected the larger strategic
  situation. Typically located close to hangars, barracks,
  or berth decks, a standard briefing auditorium features
  plenty of seating, access to power and shipboard networks
  for datapads, a lectern or speaking platform, and
  audio/video/holo equipment. These rooms and equipment
  allow senior officers to issue orders en masse and
  to make sure that all of their subordinates are properly
  prepared for the mission at hand.
  While the Alliance to Restore the Republic fields some
  dedicated warships, either decommissioned vessels
  from the Clone Wars or stolen Imperial Navy vessels,
  most Alliance ships began life as civilian vessels and
  were militarized in an ad hoc fashion to fit the needs
  of specific Rebel cells or fleets. Ships of silhouette 5 or
  larger can be fitted with a briefing auditorium, giving
  Commanders a venue in which to issue orders personally
  and en masse to the troops and pilots under their
  command.
