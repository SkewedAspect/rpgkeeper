name: Electronic Countermeasures Suite
description: Designed to blind and deafen enemy ships, electronic countermeasures suites such as Fabritech 995 ECM
  system transmits a dense stream of white noise and junk data that fogs sensors and jams comms traffic within close
  range of the broadcasting ship. While this makes the broadcasting ship hard to see or hit, the energy required to run
  the ECM suite tends to put undue strain on the ship's electrical systems. Other systems have focused modes that can
  target specific ships at longer ranges. This may be applied to all starships and vehicles.
