name: Reactive Plating
description: Reactive plating is a modification that attaches small explosive panels to the armors exterior plates. When hit by an attack, the explosives are designed to detonate outward, absorbing some of the attacks kinetic energy with the counter-explosion. It is not typically used on a personal scale, but microrepulsors and other, similar technologies allow it to be integrated into certain heavier varieties of personal armor and to function at considerable effectiveness without harming the wearer in the process. Employed properly, reactive armor can even deflect or dampen blows from weapons that would cleave through other defenses, like lightsabers. Besides the considerable weight it adds to any set of armor, an unfortunate side-effect of reactive armor is that it destroys itself as it protects the individual inside. It causes the armor to degrade far more rapidly than it would have otherwise would, which means that the wearer must repair it far more often. This attachment can only be applied to armor with a soak of 2 or higher.
