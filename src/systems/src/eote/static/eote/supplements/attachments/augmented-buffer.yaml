name: Augmented Buffer
description: This uncommon upgrade installs redundant systems within the electronics of an airspeeder, allowing it to be
  pushed beyond standard limits without risk of overload. Most teams find it simpler to replace any damaged components
  between races, ensuring that a pilot has fresh equipment for each race, rather than risk over-complicating the
  vehicle's systems. Augmented buffer may only be attached to vehicles of silhouette 2 or lower.
