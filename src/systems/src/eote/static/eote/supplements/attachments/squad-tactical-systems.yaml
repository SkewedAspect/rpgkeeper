name: Squad Tactical Systems
description: Sensor and comm systems are common installations on armor, but some groups take the practice a step further, equipping all their members with uniform packages designed to work in tandem. Squads of clone troopers and planetary militia are the most common users of these systems, but even groups of bounty hunters sometimes avail themselves of the advantages provided by operating in tandem. These sensor packages share information with all other nearby squad members equipped with the same gear, enhancing awareness and communication. This attachment may be installed in the helmet of any armor.
