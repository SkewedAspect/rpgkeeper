name: "\"Bantha's Eye\" Laser Sight"
description: An extremely simple gun sight, a laser sight emits a low-power light beam to place a visible "dot" that marks the weapon's precise target. A laser sight can help even an amateur shooter hit a target. One drawback to this upgrade is that the laser can alert an otherwise unaware target to the shooter. For these reasons, laser sights are rarely used by sharpshooters and snipers. This attachment can be used with any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon that do not possess the Blast quality.
