name: Reinforced Magnetic Shielding
description: A delicately tuned magnetic field maintains the coherency of a lightsaber's plasma beam. Though this
  modification increases the strength of a lightsaber's magnetic shielding, the blade takes on some of the qualities of
  a solid weapon. With this modification, the wielder gives up some of the lightsaber's legendary penetrative capacity
  in order to deliver punishing electromagnetic impacts.
