description: Creshaldyne Industries' Mk. III Modular Backpack is a civilian version of its popular Mk. IV military
  reconnaissance pack. Like the Mk. IV, the Mk. III MB is a large, sturdy, internally supported backpack constructed of
  hard-wearing, weatherproof textiles. It has a single large interior space and two smaller external pockets that are
  sealed against the environment with a silent, tear away textile sealing system.. The Mk. III is also equipped with a
  system of hooks and fasteners that allows up to six smaller pouches to be attached to better tailor the backpack to
  the wearer's needs.
