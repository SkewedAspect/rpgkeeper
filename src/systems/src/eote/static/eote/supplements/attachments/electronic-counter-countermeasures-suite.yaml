  Theater Command and Control System
  “Electronic counter-countermeasures” (ECCM) is
  a catchall term for a number of techniques, such as
  FAST ECM detection, frequency hopping, pulse compression,
  and polarization filtering, used to prevent or
  break comms and sensor jamming caused by enemy
  electronic countermeasures. ECCM suites require large
  amounts of energy and often reduce the effectiveness
  of a ship or vehicle’s sensors. On smaller ships like
  fighters and shuttles, as well as in ground vehicles and
  airspeeders, ECCM suites are installed in line with the
  vehicle’s active sensors, and they can be activated or
  deactivated quickly by the pilot or electronic systems
  operator. On larger ships of gunship size or bigger,
  ECCM suites are complex affairs composed of numerous
  compartments and staffed by a dedicated crew.
