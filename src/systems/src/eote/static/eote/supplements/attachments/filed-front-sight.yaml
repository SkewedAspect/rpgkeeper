name: Filed Front Sight
description: An old assassin's trick, this is the simple act of removing the front sight of a blaster pistol by filing it off. A common modification to holdout blasters (along with removing their serial numbers), filing down the weapon's front sight allows it to be drawn more quickly from its holster, and reduces the possibility of it becoming snared on clothing. Unfortunately, while this modification makes for easy concealment and drawing, it also reduces the weapon's accuracy, as it effectively makes it impossible to aim with any amount of precision. This modification may only be applied to pistol-sized weapons. Applying it oneself requires an **Average (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check**; the cost is paying others to perform the modification.
