name: Podracer Control Cables
description: |-
  If Podracing evolved from ancient beast-drawn chariot and cart racing, as many historians suppose, then control cables are analogous to a set of reins. These long, flexible durasteel cables tether a Podracer's powerful engines to its cockpit. Along with keeping the engines and the cockpit connected, they also house the wiring that connects the controls to the engines. Steelton produces most Podracer control cables, but smaller companies have cropped up lately in an attempt to take away some of its market share.
  Nearly all Podracers use control cables, only a few small-production outliers, such as FG 8T8-T and a handful of one-offs and prototypes, mount the engines directly to the cockpit via spars. Control cables are the most fragile part of a Podracer, as even the stoutest set can be snapped or sliced through. A Podracer who loses her control cables through accident or sabotage loses control over her vehicle and must either eject or ride the cockpit to a stop and hope she survives.
