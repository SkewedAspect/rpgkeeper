name: Balanced Barrel
description: Adding a functional barrel to a rivet gun can give it dramatically more range and accuracy as a shooting
  weapon. Of course, such an addition also makes it obvious that the device is liable to be fired at range, as few
  Technicians can make a coherent case that they legitimately need to be able to bolt hull plates onto a ship with
  pinpoint accuracy at a distance of several meters.
