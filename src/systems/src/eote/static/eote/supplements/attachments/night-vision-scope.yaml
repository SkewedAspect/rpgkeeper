name: Night Vision Scope
description: This attachment uses an optical system similar to a set of electrobinoculars that shows infrared
  wavelengths of light, effectively allowing the shooter to track heat signatures in dark or concealed areas, or through
  walls. It does not differentiate between heat generated by life forms and other kinds of heat, whether from natural or
  manufactured phenomena. (It is blind to life forms that do not give off heat.) This attachment can be used on any
  ranged weapon, with the exception of single-use weapons and weapons that would not realistically benefit from a scope.
