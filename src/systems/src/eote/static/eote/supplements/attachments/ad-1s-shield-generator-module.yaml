  Shield Generator Module  forAD-1S
  Many fightercraft lack
  shields, including most of the Galactic Empire's TIE
  series. Of course, many pilots view going into battle
  without shields as a sure sign of a death wish. Soldiers
  of fortune and others who fight for credits rather than
  ideology tend to prefer the thought of living to get paid
  to the prospect of dying gloriously for some intangible
  ideal, and so the highly customizable AD-1 S can be
  fitted with shield generators to improve its durability.
