  Riding tack is a catchall term for the assorted bits of equipment needed to ride or control a beast. Produced by companies like Piccatech Ltd. and VeTech, tack comes in a variety of styles tailored to the physiology of nearly every known domesticable beast in the galaxy. Riding tack includes a sturdy comfortable saddle designed for a specific beast and riding style, stirrups, headgear (bridle, halter, bit, reins, etc,), and a breastplate. Tack made for working animals replaces the saddle with a heavy duty harness that allows a creature to pull cargo sleds or implements such as plows.
  Tack can only be worn by riding or working animals. Using tack allows a character to ride the beast without suffering the bareback riding penalties detailed on page 73.
