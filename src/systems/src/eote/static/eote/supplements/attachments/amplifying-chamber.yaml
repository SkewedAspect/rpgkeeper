name: Amplifying Chamber
description: A blaster fires using energy to excite a small amount of volatile gas into an explosive plasma. That
  transformation occurs within the weapon's chamber, which tightly controls the quantity and ratio of both the gas and
  the energy. A larger, reinforced chamber enables the weapon to emit a significantly more powerful blast that can
  inflict its damage over a larger area. Over time, this increases the wear on the weapon and can lead to component
  breakdown, but most wielders are more than willing to accept this cost for the increase in effectiveness. This
  attachment can only be installed on blasters
