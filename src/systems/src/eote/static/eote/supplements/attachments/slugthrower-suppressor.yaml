name: Slugthrower Suppressor
description: Suppressors are used by assassins and sharpshooters to make their weapons quieter and more difficult to
  detect when firing. Similar to energy dampers used to silence blasters, suppressors clip or screw onto the end of a
  weapon's barrel, redirecting sound and escaping gases to reduce the noise and muzzle flash a slugthrower produces when
  fired. While they don't make the weapon completely silent they do dramatically reduce its report, making a shooter
  more difficult to detect. The major downside of using a suppressor is that in reducing the weapon's report it also
  lowers the speed at which a round travels, diminishing the weapon's damage in the process. Suppressors can only be
  used on Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy) slugthrower weapons.
