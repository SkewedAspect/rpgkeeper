name: Under-Barrel Grapnel Launcher
description: Often seen among mercenary and special operations forces, an under-barrel grapnel launcher provides a quick
  way to scale sheer surfaces in the midst of a combat situation or during a covert infiltration. A durasteel hook,
  possibly with a mono-molecular point, can find purchase on nearly any surface, while a spool of synthrope or liquid
  cable provides up to 100 meters of length. A powerful motor automatically retracts the cable, pulling the user up -
  though holding onto any passengers who are along for the ride is a more difficult matter, and requires some effort on
  part of the user. This attachment can be used with any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapons that could logically
  have a grapnel launcher mounted on it.
