name: Kimber Stone
description: Kimber stones are a type of kyber crystal produced by violent volcanic activity on the moon of Y'ness in
  the N'zoth system. They were once considered unsuitable for use in lightsabers due to the non-lethal nature of the
  blades they create. Certain Jedi Knights saw potential in kimber stones, and so a number were acquired from Y'ness
  prior to the destruction of the Jedi Order. Today, kimber stones are occasionally sold at auction on the black market,
  usually as mere trinkets by those who do not understand their true value as kyber crystals. A kimber stone is a
  lightsaber crystal.
