name: Extended Hilt
description: The idea behind the extended hilt modification is to increase the lightsaber's striking i4 and cutting
  power by using the leverage of the longer handle and a two-handed grip to help focus the wielder's strength into the
  force of the blow. The extended hilt modification is also popular among Force users of unusual height or build as a
  way to capitalize on their size advantage in combat.
