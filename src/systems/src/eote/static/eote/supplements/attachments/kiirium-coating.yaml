name: Kiirium Coating
description: An obselete shielding material once processed in abundance in the Si'klaata Cluster, kiirium was at one
  time vital to the manufacture of heavy weapons and starships. While largely supplanted by cheaper, more durable
  alloys, kiirium has properties that make it useful to armorsmiths, who can apply a coating of kiirium to armored
  plating as a relatively effective thermal shielding. This attachment can only be applied to armor that has hard or
  solid parts around which the allow can be coated, such as with laminate armor, heavy battle armor, and similar types
  of armor at the GM's discretion.
