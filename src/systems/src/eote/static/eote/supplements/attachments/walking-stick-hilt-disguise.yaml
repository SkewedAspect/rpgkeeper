name: Walking Stick Hilt Disguise
description: Often, particularly elderly Jedi constructed their lightsabers in the body of a sturdy walking stick. If
  the blade is a Jedi's life, why shouldn't it make things a little easier? The pure utility of this practice fell out
  of favor with the Jedi Order. Most elderly Jedi did not, after all, survive the Purge. Survivors, though, found a
  similar technique could hide their weapons in plain sight. This concealment does come with a cost. The awkward size
  and inconsistent weighting often interferes with use in heated combat.
