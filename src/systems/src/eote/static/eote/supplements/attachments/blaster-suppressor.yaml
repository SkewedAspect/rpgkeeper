name: Blaster Suppressor
description: Though generally not as loud as slugthrowers, blasters usually emit an audible crack or zap upon being
  fired. While military scouts and snipers are usually more concerned that a blaster bolt flash might give away their
  position or disrupt their night vision, those who operate in the galactic underworld often find the report of a
  blaster to be more troublesome. In order to address this issue, several arms manufacturers produce sound suppressors
  for a blaster muzzle, making the blaster virtually silent. This attachment can only be used with blaster pistols.
