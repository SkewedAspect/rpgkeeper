name: Integrated Illuminator
description: Operating in darkness is never ideal, but there are several ways to compensate for one's lack of night
  vision. The simplest, perhaps, is to integrate a simple spotlight, similar in most respects to a high-power glow rod,
  along the length of a ranged weapon's barrel. In addition to providing illumination in dark conditions, high-powered
  spotlights have the potential to blind enemies. This attachment can be applied to any ranged weapon that could
  logically benefit from a spotlight.
