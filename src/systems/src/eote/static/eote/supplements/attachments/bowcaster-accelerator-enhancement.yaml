name: Bowcaster Accelerator Enhancement
description: Built from scavenged blaster parts and the occasional piece from a repulsorlift generator, the bowcaster
  accelerator enhancement is the second-most common modification to Wookiee bowcasters after the automatic re-cocker.
  Essentially an upgrade of the weapon's bolt accelerators, this attachment allows the bowcaster to fire its highly
  destructive quarrels with more force than typical in a stock weapon. These attachments are only for use on Wookiee
  bowcasters, and they cannot be purchased; they must be built either by the owner of the bowcaster with an **Average
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check** or the weaponsmith who built the weapon for
  him.
