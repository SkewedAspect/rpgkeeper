name: Corrupted Crystal
description: Even the best of the Jedi can fall. The Empire scours the galaxy looking for the Force sensitives to enfold
  in the dark side. Untutored pupils wander far from the light, lost on dark paths from which they may never return.
  Many of them have either found or constructed lightsabers of their own with such crystals as they could and, in the
  course of their fall or their time astray, have committed heinous acts suffused with the dark side of the Force. They
  bend the kyber crystals in their lightsabers to their will, leading to the bloody red hue or are redeemed, they leave
  behind a weapon and a crystal strongly associated with the dark side of the Force. These crystals must be purged of
  their evil to avoid letting them fall into other hands and corrupt them as well. Thus, a Force user may take on the
  task of reclaiming these crystals. A corrupted crystal is a lightsaber crystal.
