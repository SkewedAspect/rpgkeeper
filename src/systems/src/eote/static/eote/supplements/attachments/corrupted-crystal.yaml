name: Corrupted Crystal
description: Even the best of the Jedi can fall. The Empire scours the galaxy looking for the Force sensitives to enfold in the dark side. Untutored pupils wander far from the light, lost on dark paths from which they may never return. Many of them have either found or constructed lightsabers of their own with such crystals as they could and, in the course of their fall or their time astray, have committed heinous acts suffused with the dark side of the Force. They bend the kyber crystals in their lightsabers to their will, leading to the bloody red hue or are redeemed, they leave behind a weapon and a crystal strongly associated with the dark side of the Force. These crystals must be purged of their evil to avoid letting them fall into other hands and corrupt them as well. Thus, a Force user may take on the task of reclaiming these crystals. A corrupted crystal is a lightsaber crystal.
