name: Superior Armor Customization
description: Any piece of armor can benefit from retooling at the hands of a superior craftsman. A skilled armorsmith
  can add improved plastoid or even durasteel plating to increase the protection a piece of armor offers even as he
  decreases its weight and bulk. Of course, such delicate and exacting work can make the armor less customizable in
  other respects.
