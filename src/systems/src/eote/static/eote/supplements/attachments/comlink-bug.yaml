name: Comlink Bug
description: Comlink bugs are tiny listening devices implanted into an otherwise normal comlink. When active, they allow an operator to listen in on whatever is being broadcast over a specific comlink. These devices detect both incoming and outgoing signals and can record entire conversations. As they are active listening devices, comlink bugs can be detected with proper equipment, such as a surveillance scanner.
