name: Overcharged Power Cell
description: Lightsabers are exceptionally efficient weapons, able to run nearly forever off a single basic power cell, thanks to the remarkable focus of the kyber crystal installed within and the contained energy loop of the blade. As such, tampering with a lightsaber's power cell and adjusting its output usually does more harm than good, as it upsets the balance of a near-perfect system. Those who know what they are doing can sometimes overcharge the power cell of a lightsaber to increase the power of the blade, but these changes make the power cell volatile, prone to causing unpredictable fluctuations in the lightsaber's effects. When installed correctly, the effect of an overcharged power cell is more often beneficial than it is a hindrance, but the mere possibility of the blade dimming at the wrong moment dissuades some tinkerers from taking the risk.
