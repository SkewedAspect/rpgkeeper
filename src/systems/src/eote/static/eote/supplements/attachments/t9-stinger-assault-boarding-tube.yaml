name: T9 Stinger Assault Boarding Tube
description: Pairing a docking tube with a powerful cutting system, the assault boarding tube is an indispensable tool
  for armed boarding actions. Its legitimate uses include aggressive customs enforcement and naval boarding actions.
  However, pirates also use the technology to force their way aboard a stricken ship. Pirate mechanisms are often
  custom-built, as obtaining a manufactured assault boarding tube is difficult for non-governmental entities. This
  mechanism may be installed on a craft of silhouette 3 or larger.
