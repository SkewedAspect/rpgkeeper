name: Gyrostabilizer
description: A gyrostabilizer, or repulsorlift harness, artificially reduces the weight of  the weapon, allowing a user
  to heft and aim a heavy weapon with decreased difficulty. With such a modification, a single combatant can operate a
  weapon that normally requires a team of two. These sophisticated devices are comparatively expensive and rare, and
  thus are seldom seen outside of elite forces. This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Heavy) or Gunnery Weapon.
