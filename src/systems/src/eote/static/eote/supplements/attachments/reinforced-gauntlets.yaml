name: Reinforced Gauntlets
description: Additional armor plating on the hands is a valuable upgrade for those who favor heavier armor, as well as those who do welding jobs on starships and desire to keep all of their fingers. Not only does such extra plating provide additional protection, but it ensures that the wearer is never unarmed; after all, the gauntlets are heavy enough to shatter bones when used to deliver a punch. It also helps protect the user's hands in case they are ever stuck closing a blast door or shocked by a loose wiring while performing battlefield repairs. This attachment can be applied to any  armor with soak 2 or higher.
