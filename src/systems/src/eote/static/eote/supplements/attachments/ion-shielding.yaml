id: eote-attachment-ion-shielding
name: Ion Shielding
description: Rarely encountered in body armor and more commonly (and usually illegally) applied directly to droid chassis, ion shielding provides protection against ionization blasters. Although the mitigation it grants is far from complete, the energy-dampening effects can keep a droid operational where it would otherwise be shutdown. This attachment can be applied to any armor with soak 2 or higher.
