name: Slave Circuit
description: An old shipbuilding technology perfected millennia ago, slave circuits allow ship owners to operate their
  ships, or various systems within their ships, via remote control. Occasionally referred to as the "Electronic
  Co-Pilot" or "Instant Backseater," slave circuits run all of a ship's systems through a central system bus that can be
  activated and deactivated via voice command through a comlink-like device called a "beckon call." Basic slave rigs
  allow a user to remotely activate a ship's systems and bring it to complete operational readiness, or to shut those
  systems down and lock out all users until a security code is entered. More advanced models allow the user to call the
  ship to his present location, and even allow it to fight its way there with moderate success. While popular in many
  circles, slave circuits are often mistrusted by ship owners.
