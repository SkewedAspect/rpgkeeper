name: Serrated Edge
description: The simplicity of this modification belies its viciousness. Adding a serrated edge to a weapon is something
  almost anyone can do, and giving a bladed weapon tearing edges ensures it does terrible damage to flesh and bone. This
  modification may be applied to melee weapons that use a cutting edge.
