name: Hydraulic Control Circuits
description: Hydraulic control circuits are a throwback to an earlier era of shipbuilding. Instead of using traditional
  conductive material pressed into composite wafer boards to transfer electromagnetic energy, HCCs use countless,
  near-microscopic transparisteel tubes full of highly conductive liquid metal similar in its composition to mercury.
  Held under pressure and regulated by a series of valves, this metal controls the flow of energy. Bulky, antiquated,
  and difficult to work with, these circuits do have an incredible resistance to the effects of ion weapons, a fact that
  has not gone unnoticed among spacers. This may be applied to non-fighter starships.
