description: Some sentients on the fringes of galactic civilization live a life of near-constant battle. For such
  individuals, a good suit of armor is vital, and keeping it in top condition is nearly as important. Some suits of
  armor include sophisticated self-repair suites, not dissimilar to the systems found in some droids. Smart materials,
  laminate extruders, electromagnetic assemblers and other systems work to keep the armor in one piece even under the
  greatest duress. This attachment can be applied to any armor with melee or ranged defense 1 or higher.
