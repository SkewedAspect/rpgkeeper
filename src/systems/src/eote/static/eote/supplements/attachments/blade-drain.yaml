name: Blade Drain
description: >-
  The Blade drain attachment works by creating a small power drain when in contact with another lightsaber blade. Once
  attached to a lightsaber hilt and wired into the power supply, the blade drain attachment draws energy from the power
  supply of an opponent's lightsaber via the energy blade contact is made. The draw is momentary but significant enough
  to reduce the effectiveness of an opponent's lightsaber, making it less capable of dealing damage.

  There is, however, a risk that the drawn power could overload the power supply of the wielder's own lightsaber as the
  excess power is stored, causing a catastrophic failure in the device. Users of this modification consider it a small
  price to pay for reducing the combat effectiveness of their foes, a trade off that could save lives. This attachment
  can only be applied to lightsabers.
