name: Repulsorlift Boost
description: Some obstacles are insurmountable for even the most versatile and powerful of factory-standard repulsor
  field generators. For tinkerers willing to ignore a whole host of safety warnings-and likely a few laws-most repulsor
  field generators can be pushed past factory limits, allowing for a drastic, if brief, increase in lift. Such an
  increase can allow the vehicle to "jump" over objects, gaps, or enemy vehicles or to higher ground. Some field
  mechanics have even been known to add specially overcharged repulsor fields to vehicles that rely on a different
  method of propulsion, just in case. More than one team of Rebel soldiers has escaped certain death in the face of
  overwhelming Imperial opposition, thanks to just such modifications.
