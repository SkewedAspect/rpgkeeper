description: |-
  Developed in cooperation with CorChemCo, SmartTranq is an adaptable synthetic tranquilizer designed to be used with the Model 77 Air Rifle. When the tranquilizer enters the bloodstream of a target, it immediately begins to mutate, changing constantly and reconfiguring itself to find the quickest, most efficient way to overwhelm the target's defensive systems and render it unconscious.
  Upon a successful hit with the Model 77, the target must immediately make an **Average (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Resilience check**. If the target fails, it suffers 5 strain, plus 2 additional strain per <threat></threat> generated on the check. If the check generates <despair></despair>, the GM can spend it to make the target check against the tranquilizer again during the next round. If the GM does so, increase the difficulty of the check by one.
  Equipping the Model 77 with SmartTranq costs 500 credits. This does not change the weapon's profile—it simply adds the above special rule to the weapon. If the weapon ever runs out of ammo, the user must purchase a reload (also costing 500 credits) before using the SmartTranq again.
