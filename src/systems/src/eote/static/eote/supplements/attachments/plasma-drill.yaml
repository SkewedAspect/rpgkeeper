name: Plasma Drill
description: Originally developed for asteroid mining, a plasma drill is a superheated auger capable of boring through
  virtually any material, given enough time. Although a plasma drill is rarely effective as a weapon, commanders and

  fortifications to excavating hidden underground facilities for their own use.
