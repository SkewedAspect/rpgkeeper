name: Hidden Compartment
description: These are typically very small, easily concealed compartments hidden in places such as the hollowed-out handle of a blaster pistol or the heel of a shoe. Due to size constraints, they can typically only hold items with an encumbrance of 0, such as mem-stiks and credit chips. Compartments that can hold items with an encumbrance of 1 or 2 can be built into larger items, such as a false bottom in a document case.
