  **EOD-Mk II Upgrade Options:** EOD-MK II suits lack any standard modification options, but can be upgraded with two
  valuable attachments. These attachments are integrated load-bearing gear and a data link for controlling EOD and
  demolitions remotes, such as the EOD-Mk IV. As the suits are designed for these upgrades, neither takes up any hard
  points for the armor, but each upgrade can only be taken once.

  The data link allows the wearer to control a single EOD remote and costs an extra 300 credits with a rarity of 4.
