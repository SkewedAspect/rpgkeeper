name: Threat Monitor
description: A threat monitor is a suite of motion detectors, electroreceptors, and photoreceptors that constantly monitors the armor wearer's vicinity and, through directional auditory or electrical cues, warns the wearer of imminent threats and incoming attacks. While many find threat monitors somewhat annoying to wear, they can provide a critical edge in life-or-death situations. This attachment can only be used on armor and is typically integrated into the helmet, visor, or another place where the user can easily see it at all times.
