name: Onboard Amenities Unit
description: A smuggler's vessel is usually his home, and thus tends to be stocked with familiar comforts. For some,
  this means keeping a refrigeration unit full of some favorite food, while for others it can mean well-furnished
  compartment full of libations, alcoholic or otherwise. Whatever the specifics, a ship with an onboard amenities unit
  allows its inhabitants to offer hospitality to any guests aboard their vessel.
