name: Custom Grip
description: A skilled tinkerer can tailor a weapon to perfectly fit its wielder's hand. A custom grip is crafted to
  uniquely match its owner, allowing the weapon to act as an extension of the wielder's body. While the weapon fits
  perfectly in the hands of its owner, others who try to use it find the grip uncomfortable or the weapon off-balance. A
  finely customized grip is the hallmark of a master weaponsmith. This attachment can be applied to any weapon with a
  handle.
