name: Varpeline Crystal
description: |-
  Varpeline crystals are hard, super dense minerals found on the Outer Rim worlds of Mearalis II. Ranging in color from white to a rich gold, they are scattered throughout Mearalis II's extensive mountain ranges. When properly worked, varpeline crystals can be used to slice through nearly any substance known in the galaxy. While they are typically used in industrial cutting machinery or precision fabrication instruments, these stones are occasionally used to great effect as lightsaber crystals.
  When installed in a lightsaber, this crystal produces a blade that emits a short, sharp ringing tone when it strikes an object. A lightsaber equipped with a varpeline  crystal can often cut through the thickest armor or toughest materials, and have a disturbing tendency to dismember living targets.
