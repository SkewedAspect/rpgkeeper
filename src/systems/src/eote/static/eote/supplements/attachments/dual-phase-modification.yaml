name: Dual-Phase Modification
description: Considered antiquated and outdated by the time of the Clone Wars, the dual-phase modification is an artifact of an older, more violent time. Designed to catch an opponent off guard, this modification allows the wielder to change the length of a lightsaber's blade with the push of a button. This causes an opponent's guard to falter momentarily as he adjusts to the new blade length, allowing the Jedi to press the advantage while his opponent is confused.

  description: May change blade length once per encounter as an incidental. Next attack that turn ignores target's melee defense.
