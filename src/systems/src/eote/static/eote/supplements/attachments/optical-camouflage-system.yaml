name: Optical Camouflage System
description: Popular with both military scouts and assassins, optical camouflage systems are a wonder of modern stealth
  technology. Using a series of phased array optical projectors combined with sound baffling equipment and thermal and
  radiation shielding, Merr-Sonn's "Ghost" OCS can render a wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye The PAO projectors
  allow the wearer to blend in with his surroundings by mimicking them, similar to an animal with active camouflage
  abilities, and the different radiation shields hide the wearer's body heat as well as any electromagnetic radiation
  from other sensors or communications gear. For all of its utility, however, this system is incredibly fragile and is
  not recommended for combat.
