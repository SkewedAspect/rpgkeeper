name: Optical Camouflage System
description: Popular with both military scouts and assassins, optical camouflage systems are a wonder of modern stealth technology. Using a series of phased array optical projectors combined with sound baffling equipment and thermal and radiation shielding, Merr-Sonn's "Ghost" OCS can render a wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye. The PAO projectors allow the wearer to blend in with his surroundings by mimicking them, similar to an animal with active camouflage abilities, and the different radiation shields hide the wearers body heat as well as any electromagnetic radiation from other sensors or communications gear. For all of its utility, however, this system is incredibly fragile and is not recommended for combat. This attachment can be equipped on any type of armor, but is nearly useless on laminate and plastoid heavy armor, which is often too bulky and loud to mask properly.
