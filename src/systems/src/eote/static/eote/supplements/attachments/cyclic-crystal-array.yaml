name: Cyclic Crystal Array
description: Lightsabers rely on kyber crystals attuned to the wielder to create energy blades of different types. Under
  normal circumstances, swapping out one crystal for another is an arduous process requiring the lightsaber to be
  disassembled first. Unsatisfied with this situation, a handful of enterprising (if unorthodox) Force users have
  created attachments that allow for two (or more) crystals to be installed in a single lightsaber. With the press of a
  button, one crystal is swapped for another, granting unprecedented versatility to lightsaber wielders looking for
  additional functionality from their otherwise traditional weapon. This attachment can only be applied to lightsabers.
