name: Repulsor Pack
description: While lacking the range and power of a true jetpack, a repulsor pack provides a reliable-and less
  terrifying-alternative for those new to the realm of personal flight devices. A repulsor pack allows for controlled
  descents from nearly any height, as well as hovering speeds of up to thirty-five kilometers per hour, its name being
  something of a misnomer, a repulsor pack actually consists of a number of small, relatively low-powered repulsor lifts
  mounted to the user's torso and limbs. Although the sight of an experienced user gliding through the air is quite
  impressive, the learning curve is steep. Perhaps due to the importance of leg movement in most packs for controlling
  movement and speed, the devices are sometimes disparagingly called "jet pants."
