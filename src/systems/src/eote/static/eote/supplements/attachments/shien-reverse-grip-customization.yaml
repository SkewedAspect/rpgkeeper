name: Shien Reverse Grip Customization
description: Practitioners of Form V sometimes use a reverse grip on their lightsabers to assist in many of the
  techniques common to that form. Through a few careful adjustments to the grip and balance of their lightsabers, these
  practitioners can make the weapons more suited to wielding in this manner although the modifications make using a
  traditional grip somewhat unwieldly in the process.
