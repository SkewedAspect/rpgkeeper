name: Holographic Shell
description: Holographic shells use a combination of optical camouflage and high-resolution holography to create a
  disguised exterior for a ship or vehicle. A disguise must be programmed into the system's memory in advance, and the
  memory can hold only one disguise. Once active, a disguise cannot be changed on the fly. Holographic disguises are
  only effective at distances of several meters or more, however; touching or closely investigating the disguise ruins
  the illusion. This attachment can be applied to any starship or vehicle.
