name: Decoy Buoy
description: A favourite of scoundrels and pirates, decoy buoys are often devices cobbled together from salvaged parts, including transponders and comm systems. Although it might visually resemble nothing so much as a cylinder - or amalgamation of scrap parts - a meter or so across, a well constructed decoy buoy transmits a transponder signal, emits ion streams and outputs other data and signals associated with starships. This attachment can be applied to any starship.
