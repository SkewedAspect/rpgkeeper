name: Top-Loading Magazine
description: By switching out the standard single-bolt loading system for a cobbled-together "magazine" containing
  numerous bolts, a skilled craftsperson can increase the number of rivets the gun can place per minute dramatically.
  Some use this to apply rivets more rapidly to other sentient beings, though all manufacturers consider this to be
  "user error".
