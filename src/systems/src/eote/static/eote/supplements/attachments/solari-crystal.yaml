name: Solari Crystal
description: As rare as this type of kyber crystal is, some do find their way into the hands of Force sensitives highly
  attuned to the light side of the Force. Tales of solari kyber crystals come from the ancient past, and they have long
  been thought to be mere myths. However, they do exist, and it is a lucky Force user who can find one and make use of
  it. Or perhaps it is the will of the Force that those most in tune with the light side should happen upon them. They
  are not put to use lightly, though, for they demand much of their wielder. In exchange, they provide unparalleled
  protection against incoming fire. A solari crystal causes a lightsaber's blade to widen, thereby making much more
  effective at deflecting blaster bolts. A solari crystal is a lightsaber crystal.
