name: Armor Spikes
description: While armor serves a largely defensive role for its wearers, that needn't be the rule. With the addition of
  spikes, blades, and other protrusions on areas covering shoulders, knuckles, feet, knees or elbows, armor can be
  turned into a deadly weapon of last resort. The majority of such modifications are scratch-built, though a handful o f
  armor manufacturers mass-produce kits for the armor sets they sell. Largely popular with criminals, mercenaries, and
  bounty hunters, armor spikes lend an intimidating mien to anyone equipped with them. Some professionals prefer to keep
  such deadly modifications concealed and retractable, and these are perhaps the most dangerous of them all. This
  attachment can be attached to any armor that covers the arms or legs.
