  Sublight Boost Thrusters for AD-1S
  The craft’s engines can
  be equipped with sublight boosters, which considerably increase their output. Flying at higher speeds
  also makes the vehicle harder to handle in rough conditions such as asteroid fields, but when outrunning a
  patrol boat or pirate vessel, it can be the difference
  between life and death.
