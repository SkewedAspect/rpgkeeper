name: Weapon Harness
description: Designed to allow a single sentient to field even the heaviest man-portable weapons with no support, weapon harnesses are rare among the Outer Rim territories. Worn over the shoulders and belted around the midsection or torso, weapon harnesses consist of a series of load-bearing straps and harnesses connected to a gyro-stabilized, power-assisted boom arm attached to a heavy weapon. Powered by a tiny rechargeable power pack, the harness offers its user enhanced stability and strength when using heavy weapons. This attachment can only be used with Ranged (Heavy) and Gunnery weapons.
