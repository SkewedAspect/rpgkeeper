name: Thontiin Crystal
description: Although long recognized as kyber crystals, thontiin crystals were unheard of as lightsaber cores until recently. Instead, these crystals have been utilized for their unique properties as healing aids, capable of assisting a Jedi healer in easing the pain of a patient and making their treatment easier. The needs of the war have brought these crystals closer to the front lines. After one young Knight’s lightsaber suffered disastrous damage in battle, they attempted to replace their ruined crystal from Ilum with a thontiin crystal. In doing so, the Knight discovered that the crystals’ healing properties were focused through a carried lightsaber in new ways, allowing the bearer to fight through debilitating pain. The healers of the Jedi Order are reluctant to see these sacred artifacts turned into weapons, but the desperate circumstances of the war have caused a handful of them to be repurposed in this manner nevertheless.
