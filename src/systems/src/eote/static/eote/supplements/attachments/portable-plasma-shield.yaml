name: Portable Plasma Shield
description: Armor and weapon designs oppose one another in a cycle of endless escalation. Not surprisingly, many
  warriors seek out means to enhance their defenses in hopes that it will leave them free to make additional attacks. A
  small defensive shield can provide a substantial upgrade. Energy shields take this a step further, offering a
  near-impenetrable defense while requiring much less weight and bulk than a more traditional shield. A forearm-mounted
  plasma shield's biggest limitation is its size. One capable of completely protecting the wearer requires a bulky
  emitter and energy source. It can also interfere with the soldier's own weapons, making striking a blow awkward around
  the edge of the shield.
