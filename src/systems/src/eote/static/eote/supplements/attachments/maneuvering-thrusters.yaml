name: Maneuvering Thrusters
description: Small thrusters attached to the exterior chassis of a vehicle increase how responsive it is during flight. The application of these varies considerably, from the crude strapping of rocket or jet packs to the outside of a vehicle to the careful addition of a completely separate fuel line to grant extended use. Maneuvering thrusters may only be attached to vehicles of silhouette 2 or lower.
