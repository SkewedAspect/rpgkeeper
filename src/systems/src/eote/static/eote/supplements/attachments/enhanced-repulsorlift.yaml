name: Enhanced Repulsorlift
description: As one might well guess from their name, speeders are swift craft by nature. For some pilots, however, there is no such thing as a enough speed. Enhancements and modifications to repulsorlift systems can often coax extra acceleration out of factory-standard models, despite the fact that manufacturers caution against making such dangerous customizations to their vehicles. The attachment can be applied to any airspeeder or landspeeder.
