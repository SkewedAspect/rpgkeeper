name: Water Reclamation Suit
description: >-
  Water reclamation systems are popular with scouts and hermits, especially those living or working on arid worlds.
  Produced by a variety of wilderness outfitters, like Survival Equipment Inc. and Gandorthral Atmospherics, these
  systems collect a body's waste moisture and distill it for drinking. Typically, the consist of a tight bodysuit worn
  under a suit of armor, that covers a wearer to the neck, wrists, and ankles, along with a matching pair of gloves and
  a filtermask that covers the mouth and nose.

  Made from layers of synthetic fibermesh, the suit wicks sweat away from the skin and purifies it by means of
  integrated filtration media. It also collects waste moisture from the mouth and nose by means of the filtermask. The
  water is then collected in pouches spread across the suit and can either be decanted into a larger container or drunk
  straight from the suit by means of a long, flexible tube connected to the suit's back. Adding a Water Reclamation
  System to a suit of armor allows an individual to operate much longer in desolate environments without fear of running
  out of water. This attachment can be applied to any armor that could logically integrate the necessary pouches and
  tubing.
