name: Built-In Blaster Sight
description: |-
  A typical modification used by the Rebellion’s SpecForce troops, this attachment allows a harmless beam
  of energy to trickle out of the barrel on a half-trigger pull to "paint” the target, letting the wielder see
  exactly where she is aiming Most models illuminate
  beams in the human visual spectrum, but some use
  light wavelengths invisible to the naked eye, which
  require special goggles to spot, to ensure the agent's
  position remains uncompromised. This attachment
  can only be applied to energy ranged weapons.
