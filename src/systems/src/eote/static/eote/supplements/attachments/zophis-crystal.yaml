id: eote-attachment-zophis-crystal
name: Zophis Crystal
description: In ancient days, the Outer Rim world of Zoph was well traveled by the Jedi, and some Padawans would sojourn to the distant world to seek their kyber crystal. As Ilum increased in prominence for the Jedi Order, such visits waned. Now, the world is held by Separatist forces, who would not look kindly upon Jedi crystal seekers. However, some records remain of the unusual kyber crystals gathered on that world, whose unique resonance made for devastating, if unstable, blades. A lightsaber fitted with a Zophis crystal can carve through durasteel plating with ease, but it is vulnerable to fluctuations in power from the crystal core.
