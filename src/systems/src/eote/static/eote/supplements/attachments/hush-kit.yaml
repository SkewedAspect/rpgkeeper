name: Hush Kit
description: Hush kits were originally designed to muffle the sound of ion and rocket engines around urban spaceports. Installed on a starship's engines, these devices dramatically reduces the sound engines produce. Shortly after their introduction, though, it became apparent that hush kits also make it easier to sneak ships and speeders into and out of places they don't belong. They have since become common among criminals, scouts, and intelligence agents. This attachment can be applied to any starship or vehicle.
