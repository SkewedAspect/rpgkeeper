name: Beam Splitter
description: |-
  Alliance troopers typically apply this upgrade to
  blaster pistols and other sidearms to achieve results
  similar to that of the spread barrel used on larger,
  more powerful blasters. Beam splitters function by
  modifying the Galven pattern and carefully mounting
  three or more emitters into a honeycomb configuration inside a stock blaster barrel. Shots fired from a
  weapon with this modification diffuse into a weaker,
  spread shot rather than the typical blaster bolt, giving a single shot the potential to connect with multiple targets. Rebel troops often use this upgrade to
  transform weaponry into effective standoff weapons
  used to pin down enemy troops and hold chokepoints
  in narrow starship corridors. This attachment can be
  applied to any blaster or suitable energy weapon that
  does not have the Blast quality.
