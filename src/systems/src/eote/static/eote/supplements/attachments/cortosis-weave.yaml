name: Cortosis Weave
description: Although uncommon and even considered archaic in this day and age, some armorers specially equip protective
  gear with an underlying weave of rare cortosis. This does tend to make the armor more resistant to being penetrated
  (especially by energy weapons), but the cost is seldom worth the result.
