name: Scanner-Proof Hardware
description: Scanner-proof hardware is a collection of upgrades that together make a weapon virtually invisible to
  scanners. This mod typically replaces a weapon's stock, foregrip, and any other furniture with lightweight
  poly-carbonates woven with scanner-spoofing fibers. In addition, most if not all metallic parts—frame, trigger group,
  barrel, etc.—are replaced with fiber-reinforced polycarb pieces. This mod is extremely illegal. Being caught with a
  weapon that can pass through scanners without being detected is usually a one-way ticket to the nearest Imperial
  stockade. This attachment can be applied to any weapon.
