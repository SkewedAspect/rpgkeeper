name: Sapith Gem
description: Said to originate from a strange and mysterious world called Lwhekk in the Unknown Regions, sapith gems are
  similar to krayt dragon pearls in that they were formed when rocks containing a kyber crystal were consumed by a great
  beast. In this case, the beast was a massive volice worm, which died out long before the present day. Thus, the only
  way to find these vanishingly rare crystals is to dig them out from the fossilized remains of a volice worm. Shaped
  like serpent scales, these smooth, lustrous crystals have an incredibly complex internal structure, which magnifies
  the intensity of any light that passes through them. When installed in a lightsaber, a sapith gem creates a powerful,
  intense beam that can pierce nearly anything with ease. A sapith gem is a lightsaber crystal.
