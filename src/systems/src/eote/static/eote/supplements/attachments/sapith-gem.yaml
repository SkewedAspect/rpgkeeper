name: Sapith Gem
description: Said to originate from a strange and mysterious world called Lwhekk in the Unknown Regions, sapith gems are similar to krayt dragon pearls in that they were formed when rocks containing a kyber crystal were consumed by a great beast. In this case, the beast was a massive volice worm, which died out long before the present day. Thus, the only way to find these vanishingly rare crystals is to dig them out from the fossilized remains of a volice worm. Shaped like serpent scales, these smooth, lustrous crystals have an incredibly complex internal structure, which magnifies the intensity of any light that passes through them. When installed in a lightsaber, a sapith gem creates a powerful, intense beam that can pierce nearly anything with ease. A sapith gem is a lightsaber crystal.
