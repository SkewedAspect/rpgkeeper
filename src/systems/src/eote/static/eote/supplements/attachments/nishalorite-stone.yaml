name: Nishalorite Stone
description: >-
  Nishalorite stones are found on worlds with particularly strong magnetic fields. Usually dark gray or blue-black in
  color, and possessing powerful magnetic properties, these stones are often used in electronics and magnetic navigation
  equipment. once properly cleaned and refined, they also make for excellent lightsaber crystals, as discovered
  generations ago by a wandering Jedi Seeker.

  While installed in a lightsaber, this stone creates a dense crackling blade with a subdued color that intensifies in
  the direction of a planet's magnetic north. It can detect natural and artificially generated magnetic fields such as
  those produced by generators of powerful electronic systems.
