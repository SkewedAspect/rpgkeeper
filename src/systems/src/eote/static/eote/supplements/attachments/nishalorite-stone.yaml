name: Nishalorite Stone
description: |-
  Nishalorite stones are found on worlds with particularly strong magnetic fields. Usually dark gray or blue-black in color, and possessing powerful magnetic properties, these stones are often used in electronics and magnetic navigation equipment. once properly cleaned and refined, they also make for excellent lightsaber crystals, as discovered generations ago by a wandering Jedi Seeker.
  While installed in a lightsaber, this stone creates a dense crackling blade with a subdued color that intensifies in the direction of a planet's magnetic north. It can detect natural and artificially generated magnetic fields such as those produced by generators of powerful electronic systems.
