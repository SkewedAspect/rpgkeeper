name: Barab Ingot
description: Rare variants of kyber crystals unique to the heavily irradiated world Barab I, home of the saurian Barabel people, Barab ingots are among the various crystals used in lightsabers. Found in small clusters in mountainous regions, Barab ingots are hot to the touch and glow with a fierce inner light. When installed in a lightsaber, they create a searing, fiery blade that bums so fiercely that it nearly loses cohesion. A lightsaber with an installed Barab ingot is slightly radioactive, and with a particularly good or lucky strike can set a target alight. A Barab ingot is a lightsaber crystal.
