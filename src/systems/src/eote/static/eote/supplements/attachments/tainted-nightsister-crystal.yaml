name: Tainted Nightsister Crystal
description: The Nightsisters rose and fell as a faction untouched by the conflicts between Jedi and Sith. As such, they
  had little time to adopt the iconic lightsabers as their weapons of choice. This has not stopped dark side Mystics
  from trying to fuse Nightsister magic with Sith weaponry. Most experiments yield no fruit, but some have made for
  particularly terrifying advancements. Tainted Nightsister crystals were once pure Kyber crystals. Soaking them in
  Dathomiri Waters of Life perverts their connection to the Force. The resulting blade emits a choking, putrid green
  smoke when active.
