name: Sensor Shunt
description: Sensor shunts are passive stealth systems fitted to ships or vehicles to hide energy signatures. Unlike a scrambler, which draws attention to itself even as it fools sensors, shunts are quiet and unobtrusive. Ships or vehicles with these upgrades are nearly invisible to passive sensors and are difficult to detect with even active scanners. This attachment can be applied to any starship or vehicle.
