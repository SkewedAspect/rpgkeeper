name: Christophsis Crystal
description: The crystal world of Christophsis was an early flash point in the Clone Wars, and it has seen continuing
  conflict throughout the war. Its importance to both the Republic and Separatists stems from a number of sources, but
  its importance to the Jedi lies in the pure kyber crystals that form in the world's crystalline forests. A lightsaber
  blade created by a Christophsis crystal amplifies kinetic energy in a unique way among lightsabers, resulting in
  powerful impacts.
