name: Weighted Head
description: Weapons designed to bludgeon foes to unconsciousness or death often benefit from extra weight added to the
  striking surface. This can be accomplished through using heavier materials in the construction, or just by adding
  metal bands or studs to the business end. Reinforced "knuckles" can be added to some brawling weapons for similar
  effect. This attachment can only be added to bludgeoning Melee or Brawl weapons.
