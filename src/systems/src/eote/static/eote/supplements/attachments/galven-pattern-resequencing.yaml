name: Galven Pattern Resequencing
description: |-
  Some Alliance operatives would gladly trade a little
  reliability in exchange for the stopping power necessary to penetrate Imperial armor. This makes the Galven pattern resequencing a popular upgrade among
  troops in service of the Rebellion. By focusing the Galven pattern into a tighter wavelength, more energy is
  packed into each blaster bolt, which increases damage output. Unfortunately, the added workload on
  the blaster’s tiny circuitry makes the weapon much
  more prone to failure. This attachment can only be
  used with blaster pistols and heavy blaster pistols.
