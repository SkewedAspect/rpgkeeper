name: Bipod Mount
description: Little more than a pair of folding or collapsible legs mounted beneath the barrel of a long arm, bipods are
  used to stabilize awkward or heavy weapons to improve their firing characteristics. Especially useful when firing from
  behind low cover or from a prone position, bipods are typically used on squad support weapons, or by sharpshooters and
  snipers to better steady their weapons. This attachment can only be applied to rifles, carbines, and light repeating
  blasters, and takes one preparation maneuver to set up.
