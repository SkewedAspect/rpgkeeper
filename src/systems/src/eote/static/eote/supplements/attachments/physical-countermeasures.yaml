name: Physical Countermeasures
description: >-
  Like electronic countermeasures, physical counter-measures are designed to fool scanners and make a ship or vehicle
  harder to hit. Whereas electronic countermeasures affect an opposing ship or vehicle's sensors, physical
  countermeasures are specifically designed to help a ship or vehicle evade incoming missiles or torpedoes.
  Countermeasures come in three basic varieties—chaff, flares, and anti-warhead missile pods. Chaff is a collection of
  small, highly reflective alloy streamers packed into a tube with a small explosive charge. When detonated, the chaff
  tube creates a cloud of glittering shrapnel that clouds detection systems and confuses most basic missile guidance
  systems. Flares are deployed in groups from special launchers, and consist of small incendiary devices that mimic the
  heat produced by a ship or vehicle's engines, fooling incoming missiles into following the super-hot flare instead of
  the vehicle. Anti-warhead missile pods are similar to flares, but they fire a cluster of small, low-yield missiles
  designed to intercept and destroy incoming ordnance.

  While any ship equipped with physical counter-measures carries enough to get them through most encounters, engaging in
  a long, drawn-out fight can quickly deplete a launcher's store of countermeasures. Game Masters may spend
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> or <triumph></triumph> on Gunnery checks made using missiles, rockets,
  or torpedoes targeting the starship to cause a countermeasure launcher to run out of its load of flares, chaff, or
  anti-warhead missiles, effectively disabling it until the end of the encounter.
