name: Foreign Debris Ejector
description: Podracing attracts a wide range of pilots, from those who delight in testing their skill against fellow speed enthusiasts to those who are only interested in winning, no matter what it takes. For the latter, one method is not to boost their own vehicles performance but to instead hamper their opponents Podracers. Using concealed compartments (known more informally as "dirty trick kits"), pilots can release small nails, reactive chemicals or other debris-designed to foul the engines of a training vehicle, slowing it down or even knocking it out of the running. Though illegal, when used out of the sight of officials these compartments can decide the fate of many a race.
