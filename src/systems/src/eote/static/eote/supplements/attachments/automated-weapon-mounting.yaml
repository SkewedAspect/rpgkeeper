name: Automated Weapon Mounting
description: >-
  Used by elite special forces across the galaxy-and the occasional bounty hunter-an automated weapon mounting is a
  sophisticated pseudocybernetic that allows the user to fire a blaster or other handheld weapon while keeping both
  hands free, possibly for additional weapons. Automated harnesses are most commonly shoulder mounted, although a
  variety of models are available, some incorporating articulated appendages of up to a half meter in length. Sappers
  and combat engineers often find automated weapon mountings particularly useful , particularly when combined with a
  droid brain targeting system, as the mountings allow them to effect battlefield repairs without leaving themselves
  vulnerable. An automated weapon mounting may be activated by voice or neural link. For obvious reasons, these
  attachments are rarely seen outside of a battlefield, and they are outlawed on most worlds.

  A weapon must also be modified in order to be armor-mounted, requiring one hard point.
