name: Droid Targeting System
description: >-
  Although droids are most commonly thought of as autonomous mobile constructs, the advanced artificial intelligence of
  droid brains has been used in a variety of other applications for thousands of years. A specialized droid mind
  equipped with sensors and miniaturized gyromotors can improve the accuracy of even the most experienced sentient
  marksman.

  Many soldiers look down on the use of such systems, while others find the vibrations as the droid subtly adjusts their
  aim to be frustrating, to say the least. Droid targeting systems are known for their often bossy and impatient
  personalities. This attachment can be applied to any personal ranged weapon.
