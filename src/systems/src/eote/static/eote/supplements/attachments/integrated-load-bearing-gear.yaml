description: |-
  **EOD-Mk II Upgrade Options:** EOD-MK II suits lack any standard modification options, but can be upgraded with two valuable attachments. These attachments are integrated load-bearing gear and a data link for controlling EOD and demolitions remotes, such as the EOD-Mk IV. As the suits are designed for these upgrades, neither takes up any hard points for the armor, but each upgrade can only be taken once.
  Integrated load-bearing gear reduces the suit's encumbrance by 3, and costs an additional 700 credits with a rarity of 3.
