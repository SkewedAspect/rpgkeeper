name: Ionizing Emitter Matrix
description: Few droids can stand up to a lightsaber, but some heavily reinforced droid models have been known to fight through the destruction of their limbs and even some of their core systems to achieve their objectives. Some Jedi have taken to tuning their lightsabers specifically to deal with these foes, the better to bring the war to a close by disabling the droid armies. With the right modifications, a lightsaber can be made to emit a low-level ion pulse as it strikes, although such modulation reduces its overall energy output.
