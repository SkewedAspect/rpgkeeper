name: Engine Boost System
description: There are as many ways of boosting the output of a Podracer's engine as there are engines themselves.
  Afterburners, volatile chemical injectors, overpressure feeders, electromagnetic wave-pulse generators, even arcane
  mixtures of highly reactive and dangerous fuels are all used to provide extra thrust from an engine. While these
  add-on systems do increase an engine's output, often dramatically so, they have a tendency to shorten its operational
  life and require extra maintenance to keep the engine operational and at peak performance.
