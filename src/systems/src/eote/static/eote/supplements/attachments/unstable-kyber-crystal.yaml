name: Unstable Kyber Crystal
description: >-
  The Kyber crystal is the heart of a lightsaber, but as with the hearts of organic beings, there can be imperfections.
  There are many opportunities between mining and use for a crystal to become unstable. It could develop hairline
  fractures in initial transit. Its wielder might subject it to extreme stress in use. Either way, power can begin to
  leak out of the crystal itself.

  Under normal circumstances, these imperfections will not affect a lightsaber's performance. With the right knowledge,
  however, a Force user can harness the leaking energy for their own ends. By performing a lengthy ritual with the
  lightsaber, a Mystic can draw some of its power into themselves for a time.
