name: Shadowsheath
description: Bounty hunters, assassins, and other criminals often have a need to conceal weapons on their bodies to
  sneak them past guards or get close to a target without arousing alarm. A shadowsheath utilizes optical camouflage
  technology, but rather than conceal an entire body, its smaller projector is specifically designed to conceal a single
  weapon when kept in a holster or sheath. This attachment may be attached to any weapon with an encumbrance of 2 or
  less.
