name: Engineering Access
description: One of the Explorers more intelligent design features is the network of sub-deck access passages. Granting
  easy access to nearly any internal system on the ship, the cramped passages allow the engineer to respond quickly to
  problems. Anyone working on the internal systems of the E-9 Explorer-class vessels, such as the power system,
  hyperdrive, computers, sensors, et cetera, gains <boost></boost> to any Mechanics or Computers skill checks thanks to
  the ease of reaching systems that are typically hidden behind bulkheads and sealed beneath deck plates.
