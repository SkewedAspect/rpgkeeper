name: Enhanced Carbon-Durasteel Armor
description: Produced by numerous starship manufacturers, these armor plates are made from a complex lattice of carbon nanotubes embedded with spun threads of durasteel. Molecularly bonded to a ship's hull, they provide extra armor protection at the cost of a ship's maneuverability. This may be applied to all starships and vehicles.
