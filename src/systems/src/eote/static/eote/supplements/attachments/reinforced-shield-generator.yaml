name: Reinforced Shield Generator
description: A good defense is crucial to keeping a starship operational in the rough and tumble space of the Outer Rim.
  P-K's AEGIS Shield Generators and other reinforced shield generators upgrade a ship's stock particle and ray shielding
  so as to make it stronger and to make the shields easier to manage. While the AEGIS improves only one defense zone at
  a time, further tinkering with these units has resulted in improved shield strength. This may be added to any ship or
  vehicle.
