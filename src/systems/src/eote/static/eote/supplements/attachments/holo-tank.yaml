  “Holo-tank” is a catchall term for a type of holoprojection
  system used aboard starships and in military facilities.
  Produced by a number of technology firms, holotanks
  are large, circular holoprojectors mounted in
  decks or floors, typically in the center of large command
  centers. Real-time tactical data from friendly forces is
  fed directly to the holo-tank, where it creates a three dimensional
  model of a battle that can be observed
  at various magnifications. Holo-tanks are instrumental
  in planning and executing large-scale military actions.
  When paired with proper tactical data networks, they
  provide unparalleled battlespace awareness.
