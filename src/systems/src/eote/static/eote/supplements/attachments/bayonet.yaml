name: Bayonet
description: In the heat of combat, a ranged conflict can quickly turn into a melee. While most soldiers carry some sort
  of melee weapon, the ability to also use a rifle in hand-to-hand combat can enable a trooper to act without thinking.
  A bayonet makes this a natural process and gives a weapon more reach and force than a simple knife. This attachment
  can only be used on rifle- and carbine-sized weapons.
