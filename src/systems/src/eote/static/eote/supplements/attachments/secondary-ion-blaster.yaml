name: Secondary Ion Blaster
description: A secondary ion blaster provides an extra level of offense for those expecting run-ins with droids. Many
  Technicians prefer to take enemy droids intact, the better to "recruit" them or even scavenge for parts later. An ion
  blaster mounted alongside another weapon provides just that option. This attachment can be used with any Ranged
  (Heavy) weapon.
