name: XV-09 Chemical Restraint Harness
description: |-
  The XV-09 Pacifier is one of the more uncommon products sold by Xenovet. Roundly derided by those who
  make their living with animals as a cheap shortcut used
  by quacks and animal haters, the Pacifier is designed
  to control a wild or otherwise uncontrollable animal
  through chems rather than training. Similar to a typical
  riding or restraining harness, the Pacifier is made of a
  sturdy and flexible synthetic weave that loops around
  a creature's ribs, chest, and shoulders with a heavy
  brace that sits at its withers. Built into the back brace is
  a refillable auto-hypo typically filled with a cocktail of
  behavior-controlling drugs. The auto-hypo is connected to a remote that can trigger the pump at up to close
  range, and is used in much the same way as a remote
  for a droid restraining bolt. While the drugs tend to
  make even the most cross-grained creature docile and
  biddable, they can also have a number of unforeseen
  side effects ranging from dulling a creature's intellect or
  senses to killing it with an overdose.
  Using a Pacifier on a wild animal is a temporary fix at
  best, and should only be done in emergencies. Mounting the harness on a creature requires a **Hard (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Survival check** to ensure the harness is fitted properly
  and the auto-hypo is situated correctly. The difficulty
  of this check can be reduced by 1 with a successful
  **Knowledge (Xenology) check**. If successful, the XV-09
  grants <boost></boost><boost></boost> to any Survival checks made to control
  the beast wearing the harness. In addition, creatures
  that are successfully pacified gain <boost></boost> to any Discipline
  checks. Game Masters can spend any <threat></threat> generated by
  the initial Survival check to reflect one or more negative side effects caused by the drugs. The exact nature
  of these side effects is left to the Game Master's discretion. In addition, the Game Master can spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat>
  or <despair></despair> to reflect a catastrophic reaction to the drugs,
  such as a heart attack or brain aneurysm, which results
  in the animal's death. While safe for use on animals, the
  powerful mixture of chemicals in the harness can be
  dangerous to the minds of sentient beings. Attaching
  the harness to a sentient being can result in permanent
  brain damage and even death.
