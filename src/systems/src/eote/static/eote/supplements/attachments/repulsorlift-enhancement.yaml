name: Repulsorlift Enhancement
description: A repulsorlift enhancement increases the output of a standard airspeeder's repulsorlift engine considerably. Vehicles with this upgrade deplete their fuel cells at a dramatically increased rate. Since most races are relatively short in duration, and those that are longer have the opportunity to use a pit crew to recharge their cells, this makes them an extremely popular choice with most racing teams. Installing this attachment requires an **Average (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check**. Repulsor enhancements may only be attached to vehicles of silhouette 2 or lower.
