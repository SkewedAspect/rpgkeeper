name: Combat Tested
description: Over the course of numerous battles, combatants can make a variety of minor personalizations and tweaks to
  their gear, from notches for successful missions or targets destroyed carved into the butts of rifles, to the
  attachment of trophies taken from enemy droids or the battlefield. Weapons customized in this way become comforting
  reminders of victories past, helping their wielders stay calm under fire and in tough situations, Such
  personalizations can be installed on any weapon that the owner has used through extended periods of combat, as
  determined by the GM.
