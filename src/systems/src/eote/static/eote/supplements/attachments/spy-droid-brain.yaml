name: Spy Droid Brain
description: |-
  One of the more common modifications made to the Sheathipede-class is the replacement of the crew and flight deck with an integrated pilot droid brain. This increases the shuttle’s legroom and lifting capacity, and improves both safety and efficiency. Droid-brain shuttles are typically used on CIS bases, where they cover commonly used flight paths and provide regular ferry service. A few have also been packed full of sensors and electronic warfare/signals intelligence gear and sent into Republic territory to spy on fleet movements. These spy shuttles are equipped with cutting-edge technology and a powerful self-destruct system, which they use in case of imminent capture.
  An automated Sheathipede-class shuttle can carry two additional passengers and has an encumbrance capacity of 100.
  A spy ship has a sensor range of long, carries no passengers, and gains Computers 3, Perception 3, and Stealth 3. The ship’s sensor package grants it <advantage></advantage> on any rolls made to intercept communications.
  This attachment is limited to the Sheathipede-class shuttle.
