name: Hilt Masking Kit
description: |-
  Often, openly carrying a lightsaber causes undue comment and notice. Owners of such a weapon may have many reasons to want a subtler presence, yet still keep their lightsaber by their side. Perhaps they must enter an area known to be under heavy Imperial scrutiny, or the mere presence of an obvious weapon may sour delicate negotiations. Whatever the reason, Force users may make use of a hilt-masking kit to disguise their weapon.
  Just as each lightsaber is unique to its user, so too is each hilt-masking kit; there is no "universal" kit. The needs of the moment, or the personal tastes of the Force user, dictate what form each kit takes. Sometimes a hilt may be disguised as a cane; at other time it could be hidden as a part of a more mundane weapon like a blaster rifle; it may even appear to be something much more ordinary, like  a pair of microbinoculars. The cost, rarity, and encumbrance of a hilt-masking kit are the same as that of the item it is meant to look like. Whatever form the masking takes, it provides two important qualities: it looks as little like a lightsaber as possible, and it provides quick and easy access to the full weapon when needed.
