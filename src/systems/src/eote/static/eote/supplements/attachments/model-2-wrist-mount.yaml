name: Model 2 Wrist Mount
description: Originally developed to allow species without opposable thumbs to use pistols, a wrist mount ensures that
  the user always has a weapon ready while keeping his hands free. Many users choose wrist mounts as a way to pack
  further firepower, while it is simply an aesthetic choice for some. Wrist-mounted weapons can be fired with a
  pressure-sensitive palm trigger, a particular wrist motion, or even by neural link. This attachment can be applied to
  any Ranged (Light) weapon.
