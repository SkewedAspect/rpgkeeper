id: eote-attachment-reflex-grip
name: Reflex Grip
description: Through a delicate system of motion sensors and miniaturized motors built into a lightsaber hilt, a
  craftsperson can alter the lightsaber to respond to adjustments in grip and position with greater responsiveness. The
  split-second edge granted by this system allows a combatant to more easily parry an opponent's decisive stroke or
  block each of a hail of blaster bolts. Controlling the system and keeping it from overreacting to minute or
  inadvertent motions can be difficult to master, but the defensive advantage of a reflex grip can be worth the extra
  practice.
