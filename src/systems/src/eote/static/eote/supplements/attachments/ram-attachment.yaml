description: For the most part, collisions with other ships, vehicles, or obstacles are to be avoided at all costs.
  There are times, however, when a desperate situation calls for a desperate measure and a pilot or driver must use his
  vehicle as a weapon. A number of bolt-on accessories for ships and vehicles are produced by major vehicle
  manufacturers that protect and reinforce prows or forward sections against collision. Items such as bantha bars,
  sloped fenders known colloquially as "nerfcatchers," and custom-fit reinforced hull plating are all examples of the
  rich after market dedicated to protecting a vehicle in case of collision.
