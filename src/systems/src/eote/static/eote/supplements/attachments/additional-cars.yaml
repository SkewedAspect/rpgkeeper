description: >-
  The standard Dustcrawler features three connected cars, but Dustcrawlers are designed to be modular and customizable,
  so additional cars can be added to create a larger train. Adding cars to a Dustcrawler has the following effects upon
  the vehicle’s statistics:

  Each additional car adds 1 to the Dustcrawler’s silhouette, an additional crewmember (a conductor, who coordinates
  their car with the others), and an additional +100 to encumbrance capacity. The passenger capacity increases by 10 for
  each additional car, and 2 additional hard points are added as well. Each car adds another 20,000 credits to the
  Dustcrawler’s price.

  Dustcrawlers of four or more cars are often found in use as mass transit vehicles in airless environments. For
  example, Polis Massa Base uses 5-car Dustcrawlers to ferry workers between the living quarters and the mining
  operation, carrying an entire shift of workers at a time.

  _Note:  For each additional car, select one of each type of optional mod.  Up to 10 additional cars can be added in
  this way._
