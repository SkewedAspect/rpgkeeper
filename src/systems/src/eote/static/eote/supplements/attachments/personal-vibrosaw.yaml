name: Personal Vibrosaw
description: Troopers may have to pass through a broad range of environments when on a mission or in pursuit of a target. Sometimes, this requires cutting through forest undergrowth or cutting through a bulkhead so that a unit can quickly bypass critical security systems. To expedite these situations, some troopers mount a personal vibrosaw on a bracer of their armor.  When deployed, the diamond-tipped chain rotates rapidly around a thin blade capable of cutting through virtually any material. In extreme situations, the vibrosaw may also be used as a weapon, but its rotating blades make it cumbersome to wield.
