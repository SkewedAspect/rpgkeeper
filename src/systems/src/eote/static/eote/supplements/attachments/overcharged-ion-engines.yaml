name: Overcharged Ion Engines
description: People living on the fringes of galactic society - and those involved in criminal pursuits, in particular -
  often need to move more quickly when things turn bad. Overcharged ion engines allow a ship to accelerate more quickly,
  but tend to be damaging to ship systems over time. Many shipwrights view the use of such modifications as mistreatment
  of their works, but some pilots swear by the edge it gives them. This attachment can be applied to any starship of
  silhouette 3 or smaller.
