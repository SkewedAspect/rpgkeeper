  Hyperdrive Class 4 Module for AD-1S
  Installing a hyperdrive, even a relatively low-grade one, in an AD-IS takes up a good deal of space inside of the craft, but also allows
  it to operate independently. For many mercenaries, bounty hunters, and other frequent travelers, such an upgrade is well worth the cost.
