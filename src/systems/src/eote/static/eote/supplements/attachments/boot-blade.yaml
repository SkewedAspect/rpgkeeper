name: Boot Blade
description: An excellent way to ensure an agent is always armed no matter the circumstances, boot blades are small spring-loaded knives that extend from the toes of an individual's shoes or boots to provide an extra edge in hand-to-hand combat. There are various ways to deploy the blades, such as pressing a certain point on the tongue of a shoe or stamping hard with a boot's heel. Retracting them often entails simply (but carefully) pushing them back into their compartment until they catch. This attachment can be applied to any armor that includes boots, shoes, or other footwear.
