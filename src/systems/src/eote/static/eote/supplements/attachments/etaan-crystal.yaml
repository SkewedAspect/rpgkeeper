name: Etaan Crystal
description: >-
  These unusual kyber crystals from in the deep caverns of the Mid Rim world of Etai. Given that the crystals rarely
  form fewer than five hundred meters below the surface and usually at over twice the depth, the formation can be
  extremely difficult to locate. However, the raw crystals echo any nearby sound with a humming resonance, guiding
  searchers who draw near.

  Harvested etaan crystals retain this resonant property causing the activated blades of lightsabers using them to thrum
  in harmony with the motion of the blade, and to chime at nearby sounds. The blades respond especially spectacularly to
  a clash with another lightsaber or blaster bolt, emitting a near-deafening crack and a bright flare of energies. A
  clash of blades involving etaan crystals usually results in the lightsabers being forced apart, but reflected blasted
  bolts draw in the resonant energies from the reaction and intensify on their new trajectory.
