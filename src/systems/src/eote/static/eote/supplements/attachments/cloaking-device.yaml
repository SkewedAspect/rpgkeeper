name: Cloaking Device
description: Cloaking devices are exceedingly rare and typically only fitted to starships employed in gathering
  intelligence assignments. Fueled with either hibridium or stygium, these power-hungry systems render a ship completely
  invisible. Cloaking devices are illegal to own for non-military use, a fact that is largely lost on those few
  criminals, smugglers, and espionage freelancers who are wealthy enough to afford them. This attachment can be applied
  to any starship of silhouette 3 or larger.

  reduced by half (rounded up) and can not use active sensors, comms, or weapons.
