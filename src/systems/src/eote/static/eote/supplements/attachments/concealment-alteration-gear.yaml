name: Concealment Alteration (Gear)
description: >-
  Holdout blasters and vibroknives are easy enough to hide, but when characters wish to pack a bit more of a punch, they
  need a more powerful (and usually larger) weapon. The simplest way to make a more obvious weapon or other item easier
  to conceal is to remove unnecessary parts or minimize its size. This is called a concealment alteration. Concealment
  alterations can include cutting weapon barrels, removing panels, and any other small physical changes that do not
  prohibit the item's primary function.

  PCs wishing to make a concealment alteration need to make an **Average
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Skulduggery check** and spend one hour per point of the item's
  encumbrance (with a minimum duration of one hour) in applying the changes. A successful check reduces the item's
  encumbrance by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and adds <setback></setback> to any Perception checks to notice or search for the
  item; <triumph></triumph> can be spent to make this <setback></setback><setback></setback> instead. Items with an
  encumbrance of 3 or higher are more difficult to modify, however, and so the difficulty to perform a concealment
  alteration increases by one for each point of encumbrance over 2. This means that making a concealment alteration to a
  typical ion blaster (encumbrance 3) would require a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Skulduggery check**, while doing so to a
  standard disruptor rifle (encumbrance 5) would require a **Formidable
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Skulduggery check**. Items with an
  encumbrance of 6 or higher cannot receive a concealment alteration.

  A character can only attempt a concealment alteration once on a given item, and doing so permanently reduces the
  item's available hard points by 1. Items that have no hard points may still be altered in this fashion.
