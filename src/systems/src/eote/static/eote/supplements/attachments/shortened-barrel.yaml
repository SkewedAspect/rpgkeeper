name: Shortened Barrel
description: Shortened barrels are a handy modification used by spies, plain-clothes law enforcement officers, and anyone needing to conceal the fact that they are carrying a weapon. Little more than a replacement barrel shorter than the standard one, this attachment makes concealing a pistol easier, and can improve the speed of a quick draw. This attachment can only be applied to Ranged (Light) pistol weapons.
