name: Damping Emitter
description: Careful modifications to the power cells and blade emitter allow the owner of a lightsaber to add a stun
  setting of sorts, drawing on the power of a normal lightsaber crystal, but with less intensity than is normally used.
  A damped lightsaber can still inflict serious injuries, however, as the emitter can only limit the power of a heavily
  modified crystal so much.
