description: |-
  One of the most insidious dangers of the battlefield comes not from the foes compatants face, but from the risks of their own gear failing. Regular maintenance and examination of weapons under heavy use is a must for soldiers and mercenaries alike, but sometimes modification of a weapon can make the concerns less grave. By removing complex, failure-prone regulatory circuitry and replacing it with more basic analog systems, blasters become easier to maintain and less prone to failure or damage.
  This attachment can be installed on any personal-scale blaster weapon.
