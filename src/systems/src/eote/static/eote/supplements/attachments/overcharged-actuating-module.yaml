name: Overcharged Actuating Module
description: An overcharged blaster actuating module provides for a more powerful shot at the cost of a greater use of
  gas as well as increased wear and tear on the weapon. For some spacers, these drawbacks are with the extra firepower.
  Although some kits are available for purchase many Technicians achieve the same result by scavenging parts from higher
  yield blaster. This attachment can be applied to any blaster pistol or carbine.
