name: Componentization
description: This mod allows a weapon to be broken down into a number of innocuous-looking pieces so that it can be
  smuggled into and out of places where weapons are not allowed or are highly regulated. When broken down, a
  componentized weapon looks like a collection of basic tools, comlinks, glow rods, datapad styluses, and other items
  any individual might be expected to carry. Each part also functions as that item as well. It takes two maneuvers to
  assemble or disassemble a weapon with this mod. Loss of or damage to a component ruins the weapon, and another will
  have to be acquired and modified. This attachment can be applied to any weapon with an encumbrance of 2 or less.
