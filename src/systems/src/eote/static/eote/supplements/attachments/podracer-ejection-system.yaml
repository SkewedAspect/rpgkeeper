name: Podracer Ejection System
description: This is a simple pilot's ejection seat, commonly found in starfighters and combat airspeeders. When
  activated, either by the pilot or by a dead man's switch, should the pilot become incapacitated, the seat and pilot
  are launched from the Podracer's cockpit by small, high-output, single-use ion engines. Once the seat reaches a preset
  altitude, it deploys a parachute or activates a small repulsorlift generator, which returns the pilot swiftly and
  generally, safely to the ground. Few Podracer pilots equip their vehicles with ejection systems, however, as most
  consider the added weight and complexity of the system no worth the small gain in safety.
