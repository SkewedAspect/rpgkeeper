name: Luxury Passenger Compartments
description: Corrupt Imperial officials and powerful crime lords are more likely than Rebels to enjoy opulent living
  standards. However, Rebels who have regular contact with the rich and powerful sometimes find a little extravagance to
  be a purely practical investment. While scented air recyclers, a galley stocked with Corellian brandy, and other
  luxuries have little measurable effect on the Rebel war effort, the intangible benefits offered by a display of
  confidence and power should not be underestimated.
