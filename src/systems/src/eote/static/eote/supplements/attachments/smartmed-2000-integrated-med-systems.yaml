name: SmartMed 2000 Integrated Med-Systems
description: For some, it is not enough for their armor to simply prevent injury—it must lessen the effects of those wounds they do suffer. Integrated med-systems range from automated stim-injectors to sophisticated medical computers and full-body bacta baths. Though they can never replace a doctor or medical droid, these med-systems can keep the user alive long enough to get proper treatment, or to continue fighting despite his wounds. This attachment can be added to any armor that covers the majority of the wearer's body, subject to the GM's discretion.
