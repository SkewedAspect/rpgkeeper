name: Weapon Sling
description: Slings are lengths of hide or synthetic fabric designed to allow easy handling of long arms like blaster
  rifles and slugthrower rifles. They come in a dizzying array of styles, from the simple adjustable single-strap sling
  for carrying a weapon off the shoulder to multi-strap slings made of specialized materials that allow for any number
  of custom sling configurations. These attachments can only be used with Ranged (Heavy) weapons.
