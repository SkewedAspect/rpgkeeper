name: Energy Overclock Setting
description: As deadly and dangerous as they are, vibroweapons can be even deadlier with the inclusion of an overclock setting. By replacing several internal components with precision analogs, a qualified technician can exponentially increase the speed and frequency of a vibroblade's blade action. The result is a vibroweapon that can be charged for amplified cutting power, but at the expense of causing unpredictable power fluctuations. This attachment can be applied to any vibroweapon and any other powered Melee or Brawl weapon.
