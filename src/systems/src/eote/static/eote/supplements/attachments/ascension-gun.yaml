name: Ascension Gun
description: Ascension guns are tools used to traverse difficult environments, from steep cliffs to urban battlefields. The frame resembles a gun barrel, but instead of a blaster bolt, it fires a grappling hook and tether that can latch onto most surfaces, then reel in the gun and its bearer with a localized repulsor field. Some variations of the ascension gun also use magnetized grapnels that can stick to sheer surfaces. "Ascension gun" is something of a misnomer, other used to refer not only to the attachment, but to modified blasters.
