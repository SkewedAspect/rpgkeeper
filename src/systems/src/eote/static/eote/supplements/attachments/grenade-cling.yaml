name: Grenade Cling
description: While some anti-vehicle explosive devices and some concussion grenades are equipped with an electromagnetic
  clamp as a standard feature, such capabilities are rare among anti-personnel grenades. With the addition of an
  electromagnet, adhesive polymer, plastoid webbing, or any of a dozen other measures, nearly any grenade or bomb can be
  made to latch onto its target, preventing escape and ensuring its destruction. The attachment can be added to any
  grenade or explosive device.
