name: Astrogation Droid Brain
description: To accompany its autopilot droid brain, Go-Corp has rolled out the CD-13z, an astrogation droid brain. Essentially an astromech installed directly into the ship's hull, the CD-13z can perform astrogation calculations on its own, but it is most useful for assisting in a pilot or navigator's own calculations. Despite their common origins, CD-13z droid brains are known to bicker with CD-12a autopilot droid brains when both are installed on the same vessel.
