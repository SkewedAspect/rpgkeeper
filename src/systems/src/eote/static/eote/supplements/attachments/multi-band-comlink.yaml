name: Multi-Band Comlink
description: It is common practice to incorporate a long-range comlink into a helmet. Many military or otherwise advanced helmets include a comlink as standard, and it is a fairly simple procedure to attach one to nearly any helmet. Some helmet comlinks are activated by tapping a button on the exterior of the helmet or somewhere else on the armor, while others are activated by voice or even a particular head motion.
