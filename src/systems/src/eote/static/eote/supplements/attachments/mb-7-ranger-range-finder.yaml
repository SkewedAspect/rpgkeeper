name: MB-7 "Ranger" Range Finder
description: A system incorporating a simple computer and visual sensors, a range finder calculates the distance to any
  spot in the user's field of vision, feeding him precise information to a visor HUD. With this information, the wearer
  can push his weapon to its limits, while knowing when to hold his fire on an impossible shot. The most sophisticated
  systems interface directly with the user's weapon for increased effect.
