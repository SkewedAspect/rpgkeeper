name: Imperial Storm Commando Armor
description: >-
  Storm commandos are among the Empire's most elite,

  with the most advanced equipment available. Their

  armor allows the same flexibility as scout trooper

  armor, but is reinforced to provide maximum protection against blaster fire and explosions. Both the

  bodysuit and laminate plates are coated in “reflec”

  polymer, which distorts light and absorbs sound,

  making the wearer incredibly difficult to detect.

  The armor’s helmet is equipped with macrobinoculars and scanner goggles (see page 191 of the **Age of

  Rebellion** Core Rulebook) as well as a comlink.

  While wearing storm commando armor, a character

  removes <setback></setback> due to darkness, smoke, or similar environmental factors that obscure vision from all of
  her

  Perception, Vigilance, and combat checks. Additionally, storm commando armor adds <setback></setback> to other
  characters’ Perception checks to detect the wearer.
