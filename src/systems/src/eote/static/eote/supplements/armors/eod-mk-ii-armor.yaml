  Creshaldyne EOD-Mk II Armor

  EOD-Mk II armor by Creshaldyne is one of the most popular explosives disposal suits in the galaxy. Made to
  Creshaldyne's exacting standards, the EOD-Mk II is a heavy, bulky, awkward suit of armor designed to protect an
  Engineer from blast, shock, and shrapnel while working with explosive compounds and devices. These suits are
  constructed of thick overlapping plates covered with reinforced polycarb mesh. They also include extra integrated hard
  plates backed by ballistic gel pads at the knees, groin, chest, and elbows. A tall, stiff collar of gel-backed hard
  plates covered by poly mesh protects the neck, and the head is protected by a sealed, full-face helmet. Like most
  bomb-disposal suits, the EOD-Mk II does not come with gloves in order to maximize an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)
  trooper's dexterity and precision. While this gives the wearer maximum hand mobility, it leaves the hands and forearms
  unprotected from accidental blasts.

  Due to its extremely thick padding and ponderous form, characters wearing EOD-Mk II armor lose their free movement.
