name: Hutt Shell Armor
description: >-
  Crafted especially for the Shell Hutts of Circumtore, these massive exoskeletons are fashioned from segmented
  cylinders of durasteel. Freed from the need for any sort of physical exertion by the repulsorlifts and powerful
  servomechanisms built into their armored suits, the gluttonous Shell Hutts grow to be tremendously corpulent, even by
  Hutt standards, necessitating ever-larger suits of armor. Shell armor allows its wearer to hover up to five meters
  above the ground.

  Hutt Shell Armor allows a Hutt to ignore the effects of the Awkward and Ponderous abilities (if he possesses either or
  both of these). Further, the wearer does not have to spend additional maneuvers when navigating difficult terrain.
