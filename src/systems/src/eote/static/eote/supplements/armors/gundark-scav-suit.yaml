name: '"Gundark" Scav-Suit'
description: >-
  The peculiar brainchild of an exiled Arkanian engineer, the “Gundark” scav-suit is becoming an increasingly common
  sight across the galactic underworld. Designed to assist salvagers and collectors in uncovering and assessing lost
  technology, the suit includes an advanced sensor package that can analyze energy readings and material compositions
  quickly to help the wearer sift valuable salvage from a scrap heap-or from the detritus of a battlefield. The suits
  are so-named because the arrangement of the sensor package is reminiscent of huge ears at the side of the wearer's
  head, similar to those of a wild gundark. Bounty hunters and other figures sent to deal with scavengers sometimes take
  advantage of this design by targeting the sensor array to blind the wearer with a feedback loop from their damaged
  equipment.

  The inbuilt sensor array on a “Gundark” scav-suit adds <boost></boost> to the wearer's Perception checks, and an
  additional <boost></boost> to all checks to detect or analyze technological parts and items. However, if the suits
  systems become damaged due to a Critical Injury, aimed shot, or other circumstance, the wearer instead suffers
  <setback></setback> due to sensor feedback on all Perception checks instead until the suit is repaired.
