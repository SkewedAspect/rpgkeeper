name: Performer's Attire
description: >-
  Many diplomats perform not only on the political stage, but on actual stages as well. Artistic performance often
  requires more freedom of movement than speechgiving, however. Often colorful or sporting dazzling patterns, this type
  of clothing draws attention to the wearer as he dances, sings, or otherwise entertains. Although offering practically
  no defenses, the attire does allow unequaled freedom of movement and typically formfitting material prevents
  accidentally snagging or becoming caught on environmental hazards.

  A character wearing performer's attire adds <boost></boost> to checks to perform or otherwise attract attention.
