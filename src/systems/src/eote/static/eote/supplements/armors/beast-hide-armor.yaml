name: Beast-Hide Armor
description: >-
  Blasters and other advanced weapons can make a mockery of even the most sophisticated armor. Perhaps it is because of
  this that some warriors use the same primitive armors that have been used across the galaxy for countless millennia.
  For some individuals, their choice of armor is made to send a message rather than for practical purposes. Armor made
  from the tanned hides or heavy furs of wild beasts and covered in claws and teeth is a common sight on many backwater
  worlds, but is also worn by some spacers who wish to demonstrate their own ferocity. Whether worn as a reminder of
  home or crafted from the skin of a ferocious animal slain during their travels, such a suit of armor marks the wearer
  as a predator among predators.

  When wearing beast-hide armor, the character gains automatic <advantage></advantage> on Coercion checks and automatic
  <threat></threat> on Charm checks. The GM may determine that this armor provides different benefits or detriments
  depending on the situation. The wearer of the armor may be barred from high society events on Coruscant, but
  automatically invited to similar events on a Rim world, for example.
