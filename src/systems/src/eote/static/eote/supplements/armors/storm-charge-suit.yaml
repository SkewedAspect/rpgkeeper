description: >-
  The "Storm" Charge Suit offers protection similar to other makes of padded armor, but offers several unique features.
  The padding that makes up most of the armor is highly resistant to electrical energy. While this doesn't offer any
  additional protection against blasters, it ensures that the wearer suffers no ill effects from the electro-conductive
  wiring that girds the entire suit. When switched on, the entire suit hums with energy. Any enemy who comes into direct
  contact with the suit suffers a jolt comparable to a lower-end stun blaster. When struck, the electrical discharge is
  likely to force an assailant with a plasteel or similarly conductive weapon to drop it, and may even incapacitate him.
  This armor is a mainstay of riot police within the Corporate Sector, but finds its way into the hands of mercenaries
  and bounty hunters as well.

  If the wearer of the charge suit is hit by a melee attack and the attack generates <despair></despair>, the attacker
  is automatically hit by an attack dealing 8 damage. This damage is applied to the target's strain threshold. If the
  attack generates <threat></threat><threat></threat>, the attacker is disoriented for one round. Wearing a charge suit
  counts as being equipped with shock gloves (Brawl; Damage +0; Critical 5; Range [Engaged]; Stun 3).
