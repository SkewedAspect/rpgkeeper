  The number of different types of environments found in the galaxy is staggering. Every world has its own unique mix of
  gravity, atmosphere, and environment that forms the beings who dwell upon it. While there are numerous worlds that are
  considered just right in that a substantial percentage of sentient species can dwell there in relative comfort, the
  great majority of planets, moons, asteroids, and star bases are toxic to at least one species, if not more. To allow
  those with sensitive systems to operate safely in the galaxy at large, numerous companies produce enviro-suits.

  Enviro-suits come in a dizzying array of patterns and styles. At their most basic, enviro-suits are fully sealed,
  full-body suits made of sturdy materials designed to keep sentients alive in inhospitable places. They protect their
  wearers from toxic environments, radiological, biological, and chemical hazards, extremes of temperature, and
  variations of atmospheric pressure. With the right suit, a wearer can withstand the vacuum of space, the depths of the
  deepest oceans, and even atmospheres that are little more than choking miasmas of poisonous gasses. While most
  enviro-suits on the market have built-in monitoring systems that can self-adjust to a wearer's particular needs and
  are therefore appropriate for a variety of users, some are custom built and fitted for those species with especially
  delicate or bizarre physiologies.

  Enviro-suits typically have numerous attachment points and interface sockets for the use of Jetpacks, external tanks
  for those with specific environmental needs, and storage pockets. Enviro-suits have an operational life of eight hours
  until they need to be recharged and have their gasses and fluids refilled. Thanks to their many layers of protective
  shielding, enviro-suits tend to be bulky and reduce a wearer's sense of his surroundings. An individual wearing an
  enviro-suit suffers <setback></setback> to any Agility or Perception based checks while wearing the suit.
