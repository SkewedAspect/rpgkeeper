description: >-
  The HT-77 pattern of clone armor is a specialized suit designed for operation in cold environments, such as polar
  regions or planets far from the light of their local sun. Although all clones are trained in its use, it is primarily
  issued to divisions specialized in tactics and operations for such environments. Featuring additional thermal seals
  and insulating flaps, cold assault armor greatly enhances the basic temperature-regulating functions of a standard
  clone bodysuit. Furthermore, the sensory apparatuses installed in HT-77 helmets are designed to deal with issues
  arising from cold-weather conditions. The visor lenses are treated to resist reflected glare from snow and to avoid
  frosting over when exposed to moisture, and the audio feedback and comlink systems dampen the sound of high winds and
  other interference.

  HT-77 cold assault armor comes with a built-in comlink, and it adds <boost></boost><boost></boost> to the wearer's
  checks to avoid adverse effects from exposure to cold temperatures and weather. Additionally, the wearer removes
