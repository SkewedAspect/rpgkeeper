  _Katarn_ - Class Commando Armor

  Clone commandos often accept missions that have a particularly high risk assessment and require extended independent
  operations. _Katarn_-class commando armor was designed with these conditions in mind.  Its imposing form is named
  after a deadly predator native to the planet Kashyyyk, and its capabilities live up to that name.

  Its duraplast construction provides good protection from most weapons, while its insulated bodysuit grants the wearer
  protection from heat, cold, radiation, and most known toxins. A six-hour air supply enables the wearer to function in
  hostile environments, including the vacuum of space. Integrated scanners and communications suites enable the wearer
  to track hostiles while keeping in touch with allies.

  The armor's backpack is modular, enabling it to incorporate modifications suited to battlefield needs, such as
  survival gear, additional oxygen supplies, and field electronics.
