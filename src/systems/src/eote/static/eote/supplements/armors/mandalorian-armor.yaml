name: Mandalorian Armor
description: >-
  Although the ancient warrior culture of the Mandalorians is long past its heyday, its presence can still be felt on
  many worlds. Among the most recognizable Mandalorian items are their meticulously crafted suits of battle armor. Suits
  of Mandalorian armor offer some of the best personal protection in the galaxy, and their owner typically take
  advantage of the superlative construction to install numerous additional sub-systems and weapons. While there are few
  armorers capable of crafting this armor, the prestige of owning it comes at a premium to many bounty hunters.

  Some hunters feel a spiritual kinship with the legendary Mandalorian warriors, who are described in stories across the
  galaxy as deadly—if ruthless—warriors and hunters. Others revel in the fear the suits still inspire, and many more
  simply recognize the quality of the armor as better than many of the best modern designs.

  A few warriors even claim lineal descent from the old Mandalorian clans, such as the Death Watch terrorist group from
  the Clone Wars, although not everyone takes such claims seriously. Whatever their reasons, hunters who acquire
  Mandalorian armor often value their suits above nearly any other possession, and customize them with carefully
  selected modifications. Such upgrades make the suits even more durable, provide new utility to the wearer, or conceal
  deadly tricks to help a bounty hunter get the edge in any situation.

  PCs who wish to obtain Mandalorian armor may find the effort of getting a suit worthy of the name more challenging
  than buying other gear. See **Acquiring Mandalorian Armor** for suggestions on acquiring Mandalorian armor with
  upgrades installed.
