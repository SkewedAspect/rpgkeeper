  Before the Empire, Tholothian Defense Forces looked the same as their offworld counterparts. Guards wore synthetic
  body armor and wielded transparisteel riot shields. When deadly force was necessary, they carried a variety of
  blasters to do the job. While beautiful and poignant, traditional equipment lacked the practicality of offworld gear.
  In the years following the Clone Wars, the Empire sought to tighten its grip over the Outer Rim. Though it took years
  to make it there, the full brunt of Imperial force finally made its way to Tholoth.

  Imperial blockades drove the cost of importing weapons and body armor beyond feasibility. Anything deemed contraband
  entering the system was immediately seized. Factories mass-producing weapons were co-opted by the Empire. Traditional

  weaponsmiths became the sale reliable source of arms and armaments. Before the Empire, Tholothians took their heritage
  for granted. Now that it is their last weapon against the Empire, Tholothians have embraced it with open arms.

  The Timber Cuirass has become one of the planet's best products-a modern update for ancient Tholothian armor. Armorers
  crafted the classic cuirass from a single living piece of Heartwood. Generally, a noble would commission it as soon as
  they came of age, as the process could take decades. The cuirass must be shaped and refined while still growing as
  part of the tree. On completion, the resulting armor is as strong as durasteel, but only a fraction of the weight.
