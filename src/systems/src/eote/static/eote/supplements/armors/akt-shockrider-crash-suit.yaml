description: >-
  Specially designed for those who make their living behind the wheel, the Shockrider crash suits from Ayelixe/Krongbing
  Textiles Corporation are built to help pilots of speeders, speeder bikes, swoops, and other fast atmospheric vehicles
  survive even the worst crashes. Made of tough synthetic materials reinforced with a light armored mesh, a crash suit
  consists of a snug-fitting full-body suit with heavy fasteners, gloves, boots, and a helmet. All of these components
  fit together to grant the greatest protection possible to the wearer. They are also reinforced with special
  impact-absorbing gel inserts at strategic areas, like the spine, elbows, knees, hips, palms of the hands, and
  shoulders. This helps mitigate shocks to the areas of the body that are typically the first to take damage in an
  accident. In addition to these protections, the materials of a crash suit are also embedded with a fire- and
  radiation-proof chemical to help wearers survive the fires that often break out during crashes.

  Thanks to their durable construction and integrated armor, crash suits reduce any strain received from Critical Hits
  dealt to the wearer's vehicle by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and the flame-resistant coating reduces damage dealt to the
  wearer by fires by 1.
