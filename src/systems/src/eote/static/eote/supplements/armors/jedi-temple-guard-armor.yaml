name: Jedi Temple Guard Armor
description: >-
  The Jedi Temple Guard were some of the best fighters the Jedi Order had to offer, sworn to protect the temple to the
  end. The armor they wore was as imposing as it was effective. Temple Guard armor consists of brown armored robes a
  helmet and an impassive, emotionless mask. Anonymity was as important to a Jedi Temple Guard as combat skill, and they
  were sworn to be completely impartial in the execution of their duty. Though the records state that all members of the
  Jedi Temple Guard were slain by Darth Vader and the 501st Legion troops he lead, some of their battlegear survives in
  private collections and lost corners of the galaxy.

  The armored mask contains a helmet comlink and an in-helmet scanner.
