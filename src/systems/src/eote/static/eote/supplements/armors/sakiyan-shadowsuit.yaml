name: Sakiyan Shadowsuit
description: >-
  Woven from the silk of the umbraspider, Sakiyan shadowsuits are used by assassins who wish to remain unseen. The silk
  has unusual properties, refracting and absorbing light in a way that makes the umbraspiders webs virtually invisible.
  The Sakiyans have put this extraordinary material to use in crafting body gloves that make the wearer almost
  impossible to see except in bright light. Chemists working for Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles were able to synthesize
  shadowsilk by studying the properties of Defel fur, but Sakiyans contend that the silk of the umbraspider is superior.

  A Sakiyan shadowsuit grants <boost></boost><boost></boost> to Stealth checks.
