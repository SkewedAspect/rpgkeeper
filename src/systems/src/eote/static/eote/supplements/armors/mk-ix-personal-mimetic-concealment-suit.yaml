  Cyricept Mk IX Mimetic Concealment Suit

  Cyricept's Mk IX Personal Mimetic Concealment Suits use active stealth technologies combined with advanced textiles to
  provide one of the best personal stealth suits available. When active, a mimetic suit uses an optical camouflage (OC)
  system that bends light around the wearer and reflects back images of the surrounding area. This OC system is combined
  with electromagnetic and heat shielding, sound bafflers, and other systems to render a wearer essentially invisible to
  both the naked eye and most common security sensors. To run these systems, mimetic suits require a small, high-output
  energy cell built into a belt or wristband. Mimetic suits consume energy at an extremely high rate, and a power pack
  is good for about an hour of constant use. Like all mimetic suits, the Mk IX is illegal to own and to sell to
  civilians. While they are primarily used by governmental intelligence and law enforcement agencies, many suits have
  found their way into the hands of dangerous criminals throughout the galaxy.

  Wearing a Mk IX Personal Mimetic Concealment Suit upgrades the ability of all Stealth checks made by the wearer twice.
  In addition, the Game Master may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> on
  any Stealth check made by the wearer while the suit is active to have the suit's power pack run dry. The suit cannot
  be used again until the power pack is replaced; replacing a power pack requires a maneuver.
