name: Biogel Suit
description: >-
  During martial arts training, both students and teachers put themselves at risk as they work through the process of
  education. A wayward strike can cause grievous injury, particularly when a participant is practicing at full speed or
  training with weapons. Steps must be taken to mitigate this risk, so that safety can be increased during the training
  process. While some argue that this decreases the sense of risk felt during training, the effective counterargument
  states that not every simulation has to be life threatening, particularly the earliest ones.

  Biogel suits are semi-translucent, organic body gloves that completely encase the wearer. They provide protection
  against attacks such that while the defender can still feel an impact, the risk of injury is substantially reduced.
  However the suits are bulky, which can limit wearers' flexibility as well as their ability to dodge an attack or
  strike at full strength.

  The armor gains +1 soak when the wearer suffers damage from Brawl weapons or bludgeoning Melee weapons. A character
  adds <setback></setback> to any Brawn- or Agility-based checks while wearing this armor.
