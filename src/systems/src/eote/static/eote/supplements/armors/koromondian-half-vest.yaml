name: Koromondian Half-Vest
description: >-
  Referred to snidely as "bounty hunter insurance" by cynics across the galaxy, the Koromondian half-vest is a common
  variation of the Mk 45 protective vest produced by the Koromondian PDS, Inc. The vest is designed to protect the
  wearer from ambushes and sudden attacks from unexpected directions. However, its durability is sch that it quickly
  loses its  protective qualities as it absorbs damage. Despite this drawback, its low cost endears it to bounty
  hunters, paramilitary forces, security firms and anyone else short on credits.

  Whenever a character wearing a Koromondian half-vest suffers a Critical Injury, the armor suffers minor damage (or
  becomes damaged by one additional step if it is already damaged, as described on page 166 of the Force and Destiny
  core rulebook.)
