name: Formal Council Armor
description: >-
  In rare circumstances, Jedi were called in to treat with societies for which status and associated symbols played a
  significant factor in negotiations. Some cultures maintain intricate systems of etiquette or strictly enforce caste
  systems. Other cultures engage in ostentatious demonstrations of wealth among their ruling classes. These societies
  expected any negotiator from the Republic to conform to their standards. In these circumstances a Jedi might don a
  suit of formal Council armor to aid in the critical first impression.

  Never common, these ornate suits of armor are now almost unknown. While they were comparable in function to far more
  common armored robes, they incorporated a variety of inlays and artistic flourishes-as well as a range of semiprecious
  metals and gemstones. Each suit was custom crafted, integration different designs.

  A character wearing former Council armor adds automatic <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> to Negotiation
  checks when interacting with individuals who hold Jedi in high regard. At the GM's discretion, the character may add
  automatic <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> to Coercion checks when interacting with individuals who hate
  or fear the Jedi (such as representatives of the Galactic Empire).
