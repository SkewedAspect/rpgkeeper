name: Heavy Battle Armor
description: >-
  Certain heavy stormtroopers, bounty hunters, and even droids are fitted with heavy armor. Ostensibly, heavy armor
  protects against most normal blaster shots, but in the arms race of offense versus defense, the offensive power of a
  good blaster is still far ahead of most anything a humanoid can wear.

  Heavy battle armor can be sealed and provide the same benefits as full-body laminate armor as above, or it can take
  the form of a heavy vest and blast helmet.

  **Models Include:** Mandalorian Shock Trooper Armor.
