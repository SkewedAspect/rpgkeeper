name: Powered Capacitive Armor
description: >-
  Another variant on the popular, lightweight line of protection, capacitive armor offers moderate protection against
  most forms of attack at all times. However, an expensive, miniaturized power source in the armor can be activated to
  make the flexible panels within stiffen, offering increased protection at the expense of mobility.

  As a maneuver, the wearer may power up or power down the armor. While the armor is powered and the plates are locked
  in place, the wearer gains + 1 soak and + 1 defense but loses his free maneuver during each of his turns.

  **Models include:** A/KT Tuff-Powered Armor.
