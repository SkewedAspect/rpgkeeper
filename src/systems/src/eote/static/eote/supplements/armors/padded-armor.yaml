name: Padded Armor
description: >-
  Local forces and soldiers of the Rebel Alliance often  wear padded armor, woven with tough, energy-resistant fibers.
  It tends to absorb and resist some of the power of a blaster bolt, although it often proves little use against a solid
  hit. It does, however, provide reasonable protection against blows or concussive damage, providing padding against
  such shocks. It also has the advantage of  being relatively comfortable; many individuals can wear  padded armor
  without generating too much attention  from local law enforcement on frontier worlds.

  **Models Include:** TaggeCo. “Protector X" Law Enforcement Armor.
