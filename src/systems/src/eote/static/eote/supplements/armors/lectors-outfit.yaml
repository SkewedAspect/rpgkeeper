description: >-
  For major addresses, politicians usually rely advanced, large-scale public address systems. However, most political
  agents have at one time or another found themselves pressed to make a grand speech with little preparation. Quick
  thinking usually carries such speeches, but an outfit equipped with technology to make one audible even above a
  roaring crowd helps. Several small, powerful speakers and a collar microphone make sure that the wearer's words reach
  even distant ears.

  A character wearing a lector's outfit adds <boost></boost> to any social check involving a large group of listeners,
  and can be heard clearly even at considerable distances.

  **Models include:** TaggeCo "Confidence" Outfit.
