name: Scavenged Clone Armor
description: >-
  Bounty hunters, pirates, and other misfits often seek out the heavy protection of laminate armor and heavy bodysuits,
  only to find the expensive construction of the gear they seek to be a significant obstacle. However, the battlefields
  of the Clone Wars have proven to be a veritable treasure trove of military-grade gear for scavengers, and the durable
  armor of the clone troopers has made scavenging laminate plating nearly an industry unto itself.

  The scavenged suits are even more ill-fitting than standard clone armor, and they sometimes draw unwanted Republic
  attention, but for many, affordable protection of such quality is worth the other issues. Due to the piecemeal nature
  of its construction and the difficulty of adapting the specific fit of clone armor, all wearers of scavenged clone
  armor suffer <setback></setback> to Coordination and Stealth checks while wearing it. Characters wearing scavenged
  clone armor may suffer one or more <setback></setback> on interactions with Republic officials and representatives, at
  the GM's discretion.
