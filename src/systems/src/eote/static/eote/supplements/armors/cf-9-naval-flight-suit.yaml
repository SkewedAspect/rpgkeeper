  CF-9 Republic Naval Flight Suit

  Clones assigned to operate starfighters, combat airspeeders, and similar vehicles are not typically issued full
  bodysuits of armor like their brethren in the infantry. Instead, the Republic Navy has developed new flight suits
  appropriate for combat missions. The CF-9 model flight suit was an attempt to offer everything a pilot needed for
  missions without exacerbating the already substantial cost of supplying fighter wings. The project has been a mixed
  success in both regards, but it serves well enough to satisfy the Senate.

  The CF-9 is lightly armored—just enough to provide basic protection in case the wearer is separated from their craft
  and to improve survival chances in the case of a crash or ejection. It lacks many of the features of full armor,
  relying instead on basic subsystems, an environmental seal, and the communication systems of the piloted craft rather
  than having such features built in. The suit's design instead focuses on regulating a clone's physiology during combat
  maneuvers, through its specialised respirator and other systems.

  CF-9 flight suits include a built-in respirator. Characters wearing CF-9 Republic naval flight suits remove up to
  <setback></setback> from Piloting (Space) and Piloting (Planetary) checks added due to the danger or physical stress
  of the action.
