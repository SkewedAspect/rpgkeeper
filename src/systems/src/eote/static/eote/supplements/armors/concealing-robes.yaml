description: >-
  Many ancient Jedi Knights favored heavy concealing robes for their anonymity, and now Force users throughout the
  galaxy use them to avoid notice. While they can be made in a variety of styles from nearly any material, all
  concealing robes are many-layered, floor-length garments with deep hoods which can easily obscure an individual's
  shape and hide his face in shadow and folds of cloth.

  Thanks to their cut and construction, concealing robes add <setback></setback> to checks to notice or recognize an
  individual wearing them.

  **Models Include:** Various cuts and combinations.
