  "Steelskin" Anti-Concussive Armor


  Some of the heaviest non-powered personal armor on the market, Steelskin armor is illegal on most worlds and sure to
  draw significant attention in even the roughest of Outer Rim settlements. The sheer weight of the armor deters many
  potential users, and only the most physically able of warriors can wear it for any amount of time. 


  All Brawn and Agility based checks while wearing Steelskin armor gain <setback></setback>. Whenever the bearer is
  staggered or disoriented from a weapon quality, reduce the rounds staggered or disoriented by 1.
