name: Hunter's Trophy Armor
description: >-
  Bounty hunters who specialize in wild mammals and

  dangerous beasts sometimes make a habit of collecting trophies to show off their accomplishments. These trophies, from
  horns and teeth to hides and pelts, may end up on display in the bounty hunter's homes or ships, or these hunters
  might put them to more practical use. These hunters sometimes commission gear

  made from the trophies they have collected, gathering the toughened hides of whatever nigh-unstoppable creatures they
  have defeated so that their prey's resilience passes on to them.

  A character wearing trophy armor suffers <setback></setback> to Charm checks, but gains <boost></boost><boost></boost>
  to Coercion checks due to the armor's intimidating appearance. At the GM's discretion, Charm checks made to impress or
  persuade other character of the wearer's prowess may receive <boost></boost><boost></boost> instead of
  <setback></setback>.

  Trophy armor has two Prices and Availabilities on **Table 2-4: Armor**. Use the first price listed ([R] 2,000/9) if a
  character is attempting to purchase an existing suit of trophy armor outright, and the second price listed ([R]
  1,000/6) if a character has already procured a suitable hide and wishes to have it fashioned into trophy armor by an
  artisan.
        
  _Note:  If making your own suit from owned hides, price/rarity drops to 1000/6._
