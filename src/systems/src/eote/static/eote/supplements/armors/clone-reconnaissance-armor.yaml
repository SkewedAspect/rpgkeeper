name: Clone Reconnaissance Armor
description: >-
  Often, clone troopers need to operate in environments and situations where stealth is vital. Troopers tend to use
  clone reconnaissance armor for such missions. Its lighter weight, increased flexibility, and enhanced sensor suite aid
  soldiers during independent operations. Prior to each mission in a new environment, troopers typically repaint these
  suits with camouflage that integrates colors and patters typical of the terrain where they expect to deploy.

  Characters wearing clone reconnaissance armor add <boost></boost> to Stealth checks they make. These suits incorporate
  visors with integrated thermal and low-light sensors, allowing wearers to remove <setback></setback> from visual
  Perception checks they make.
