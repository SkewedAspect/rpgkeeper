name: Mimetic Suit
description: >-
  A combination of highly advanced materials and applied sciences, mimetic suits are the apex of personal cloaking
  technology. Able to bend light around the wearer to make him virtually invisible, the suit also contains sound
  dampeners, as well as electromagnetic and heat shielding, to make him even stealthier. While other stealth suits rely
  principally on special materials, mimetic suits must actually be energized in order to cloak the wearer, and they
  require a small power pack, generally affixed to the belt, to function properly. The power packs are usually only good
  for an hour of continuous use before they need to be switched out or recharged. Illegal to own and difficult to
  obtain, mimetic suits are much sought after by criminals, thieves, and assassins throughout the galaxy.

  Upgrade the ability of Stealth checks the wearer makes while wearing a mimetic suit twice while it is active. The GM
  may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> on any Stealth check the wearer
  makes while the suit is active to have the battery run out of energy, causing the suit to stop functioning until it is
  replaced.
