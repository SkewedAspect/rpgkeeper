name: Waterweave
description: >-
  Waterweave is a composite material created out of native Semblan alloys and minerals. While it is heavy and bulky
  normally, its buoyancy actually increases while submerged. Most scientists are at a complete loss to explain this, and
  mumble something about air pockets when pressed.

  Waterweave deflects even the strongest blows instead of absorbing their force. Moreover, its buoyancy allows users to
  fight in the water without being dragged down by what would normally be bulky, restricting clothing. Warriors equipped
  with waterweave report fighting better underwater than on any other terrain.

  Waterweave armor has encumbrance 7. However, while submerged, the armor's encumbrance changes to 0.
