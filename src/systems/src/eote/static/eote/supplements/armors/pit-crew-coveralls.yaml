description: >-
  Working as a mechanic in a pit crew, whether fixing lowly groundcars on a dusty Outer Rim backwater or maintaining
  elaborate podracers in a high-end racing circuit, is a dirty job. It requires clothing that stands up to hard wear and
  resists chemicals, fuels, lubricants, paints, welding spatter and anything else heavy work can throw at it. Pit crew
  coveralls are thus ubiquitous wherever individuals work with racing machines or other powerful vehicles. These
  garments are sturdy, one-piece suits that fit over regular clothes to protect both the clothes and the wearer. They
  are typically made of sturdy, tear-proof textiles and secured with heavy-duty clasps and zippers. Most are flame
  resistant and some can even be sealed up with a helmet to act as an emergency, limited-use environmental suit. No
  matter the type, though, pit crew coveralls are always covered in pockets and hanging tabs that allow a wearer to
  carry tools and parts with ease.

  When wearing pit crew coveralls, a character reduces damage she suffers from fires and weapons with the Burn quality
