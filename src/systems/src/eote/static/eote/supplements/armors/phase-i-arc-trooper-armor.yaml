name: Phase I ARC Trooper Armor
description: >-
  Worn by the Grand Army of the Republic's elite Advanced Recon Commandos. Phase I ARC armor filled a gap between
  standard clone trooper armor and the heavy, highly advanced Katarn-class armor. Like the clone trooper armor from
  which it is derived, Phase I ARC armor is a full suit of plastoid armor worn over a formfitting bodysuit. It has
  heavier armor on the forearms, thighs, and chest, and an advanced helmet that features a hardened long-range comlink.
  A skirtlike kama made from advanced armored textiles is worn around the waist, providing extra protection to the legs
  and groin, and each suit is equipped with a built-in load-bearing harness and a survival pack.

  The various systems built into Phase I ARC trooper armor remove <setback></setback> from all Perception checks made by
  the wearer and provide all the benefits of a hardened comlink. In addition, the integrated load-bearing harness
  increases the wearer's encumbrance threshold by 3.
