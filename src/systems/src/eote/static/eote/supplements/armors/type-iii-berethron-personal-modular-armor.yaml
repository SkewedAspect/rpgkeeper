description: Manufactured for the Corellian military and CorSec forces, the Type III "Berethron" Personal Modular Armor
  system is a relatively lightweight form of armored clothing that allows for significant mission-specific
  customization. Made of an energy-dispersing mesh fiber, with strategically placed plastoid plates woven into the
  fabric, Berethron PMA provides a good degree of protection without severely impeding the wearer. The ability to
  significantly customize and upgrade the armor distinguishes Berethron PMA from other armored clothing, allowing the
  wearer to be prepared for many situations without donning cumbersome, restrictive laminate or heavy battle armor.
