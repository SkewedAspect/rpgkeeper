name: Hauling Harness
description: >-
  Beloved by harried quartermasters across the galaxy, hauling harnesses offer convenient means to lift and move heavy
  loads. Essentially a light cyber-exoskeleton, the hauling harness greatly magnifies the user's ability to lift and
  move heavy objects, albeit with limited speed. Although not as practical as a dedicated piece of heavy machinery, the
  harness incorporates a folding design, enabling easy storage when not in use.

  A character wearing a hauling harness increases his encumbrance capacity by 6, but also upgrades the difficulty of any
  combat check he makes twice.

  **Models include:** TaggeCo. Mobile Lifting Gear.
