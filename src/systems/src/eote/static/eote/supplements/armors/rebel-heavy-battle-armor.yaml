name: Rebel Heavy Battle Armor
description: >-
  Most Alliance field tactics focus on hit-and-fade strikes, sabotage and denial operations, but sometimes the Rebellion
  has no choice but to stand and fight against Imperial forces. Unfortunately, the Rebellion lacks the manpower and
  weapons to dominate the Empire in field warfare. Rebel infantry uses heavy battle armor to help ensure their survival
  when outmanned and outgunned by superior Imperial numbers.

  Rebel heavy battle armor is a combination of composites, laminate and armored clothing that provides significant
  overall protection. The base layer is made of armorweave cloth to dissipate blaster bolts and plastoid segments over
  top to protect from fragmentation and blunt force. The combination of materials provides heavy protection while
  allowing freedom of movement, unlike most full laminate battle suits.

  Rebel heavy battle armor is equipped with helmet-fitted breath mask and respirator (see page 195 of the **Age of
  Rebellion ** Core Rulebook).
