name: Fabricator's Protective Gear
description: >-
  Worn by welders, machinists, tinkerers, and mechanics throughout the galaxy, fabricators' protective gear is a
  catchall term for a varied collection of heavy padded clothing. These outfits are designed to offer protection from
  industrial mishaps as well as combat explosions. Most come complete with a full coverall , heavy gloves, dark-tinted
  goggles or face mask, and a reinforced apron. While not as effective as real combat armor, they can still protect an
  individual from the blast effects from splinters and shrapnel.

  This armor allows the wearer to ignore the effects of fires or acids of rating 1 or 2. It has a soak value of 3
  against damage from weapons with the Blast quality, but only when that quality is activated and used to inflict damage
  on the wearer. It provides only 1 point of soak against all other damage that was not inflicted through that quality.
