description: >-
  Designed with the combat engineer in mind, pioneer armor consists of a rugged, reinforced jacket and trousers; sturdy
  boots with plasteel toe caps; gloves; and a modified engineer's helmet. The suit is reinforced with thick layers of
  ballistic polymer to provide extra protection to sensitive areas. What sets pioneer armor apart from normal padded
  armor is the suit's integrated load-bearing system. Composed of numerous adjustable loops, straps, hooks, and sealable
  pockets and an integrated tool belt, the armor distributes weight and provides easy access to tools and supplies in
  the field.
