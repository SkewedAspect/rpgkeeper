name: Mk. III Flak Vest
description: >-
  The Mk. III flak vest from Pacnorval Defense Systems is a basic jacket consisting of light durasteel plates under
  layered ballistic fabric. Flak vests are designed to protect against shrapnel and heat such as that created by frag
  grenades, and offer only limited protection against

  direct hits. Flak vests are almost useless against blasters, and as such are seldom seen outside of security forces
  expecting little resistance and backwater worlds.

  This armor gains +1 soak when the wearer suffers damage from the Blast quality.
