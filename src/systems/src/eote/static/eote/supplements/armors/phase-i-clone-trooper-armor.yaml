name: Phase I Clone Trooper Armor
description: >-
  Mass-produced alongside the first batches of clones by the Kaminoans, the first designs of clone armor emphasize
  function and protection. Made of full-body laminate plating over a sealed bodysuit, Phase I clone trooper armor
  provides a degree of body-temperature regulation to offset the weight and enclosure. It is pressurized to provide
  brief protection against vacuum-not enough to allow extended operations, but sufficient for a few minutes of life
  support in an emergency.

  While offering reliability and protection, along with limited inbuilt systems and room for customization, this armor
  does have one notable flaw. The designers of the clone army placed the comfort of their creations very low on their
  priorities, leaving the armor significantly more cumbersome and uncomfortable than it could be. Adjusting to the armor
  has become a rite of passage for clone troopers, such that veterans can spot new clones within moments by how they
  move in full gear.

  Phase I clone trooper armor includes a comlink. At the GM’s discretion, characters unused to moving in this armor may
  suffer <setback></setback> to Coordination checks until they acclimatize to the distribution of its weight.
