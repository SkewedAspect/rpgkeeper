name: Phase I ARC Trooper Armor (Rise of the Separatists)
description: >-
  The elite ARC troopers within the Grand Army of the Republic receive special gear, including a unique type of
  reinforced armor. To help them survive their dangerous assignments, ARC troopers benefit from the protection of
  additional armor plating on their body and limbs, as well as a more advanced helmet design and an armored pauldron for
  displaying rank insignia. ARC trooper armor can support a wider variety of integrated subsystems than standard clone
  trooper armor, and the additional protective plates are carefully placed to optimize deflection of standard blaster
  fire patterns. The armor's careful design and fitting also allows a wider and more natural range of movement than
  standard clone trooper armor.

  However, all this increased customization and the more complex systems come at a substantial cost increase, and the
  Senate is loath to authorize mass production of the suits. Instead, a project has been launched to design a new
  variant of the armor that incorporates the advances it provides in a more economical fashion. Unfortunately, these new
  designs are still in their early stages and may not see deployment for some time.

  Phase I ARC trooper armor includes a comlink. The various systems built into Phase I ARC trooper armor remove
  <setback></setback> from all Perception checks made by the wearer. In addition, the integrated load-bearing harness
  increases the wearer's encumbrance threshold by three.
