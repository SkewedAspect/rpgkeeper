name: Cresh "Luck" Armor
description: >-
  Creshaldyne riot armor is a popular choice among police and paramilitary units across the galaxy. It consists of an
  armored chest piece and accompanying helmet with a flip down face shield. With the addition of a short-range infrared
  sensor system, it can also warn of nearby threats within thirty meters, allowing the wearer an additional split second
  to respond to them. It is this feature that gives Cresh "luck" armor its name.

  When active, the infrared sensor array detects any mass greater than ten kilograms that is moving faster than one
  meter per second, as well as other hazards defined by its programming.

  The wearer of Cresh luck armor adds automatic <advantage></advantage> to Vigilance checks.
