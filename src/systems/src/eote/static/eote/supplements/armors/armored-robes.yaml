name: Armored Robes
description: >-
  Often worn by Jedi engaging in dangerous activity during the Clone Wars, armored robes grant exceptional protection.
  Armored robes are distinct and unmistakable, however, making them uncommon in Imperial space. Durable, hard-wearing
  robes are draped over a variant on the standard Jedi tunic and pants. Attached to the tunic and pants are sets of
  plasteel plates that provide similar protection to heavy battle armor. Of course, such gear is highly illegal on any
  Imperial world.
