name: Second Skin Armor
description: >-
  Like most types of armored clothing, second skin armor offers moderate protection while still enabling easy movement
  and flexibility. Unlike most forms, though, this variant remains remarkably thin and can often even be hidden under a
  layer of looser, non-protective clothes, making it almost undetectable. The lightweight nature of second skin armor,
  however, carries a correspondingly higher cost without offering a measurable increase in protection.

  Add <setback></setback><setback></setback> to a character's Perception checks to notice second skin armor on the
  wearer.

  **Models include:** Preparix Second Skin, Aylixe/Krongbing Undershield.
