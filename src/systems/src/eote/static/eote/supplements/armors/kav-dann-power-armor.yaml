name: Kav-Dann Power Armor
description: >-
  Developed by the various interests and groups in secret on Nubia following the Empire's rise to prominence. Kav-Dann
  series power armor is named after a reptilian predator native to the world. Though intended for sale to the Rebel
  Alliance, the Imperial presence on Nubia has prevented meaningful distribution of the experimental suit. Available at
  a premium price, especially considering its clandestine status. Kav-Dann power armor presents a highly customizable
  canvas for individuals involved in high-risk combat situations.

  Bulky and intimidating, Kav-Dann power armor presents a fully sealed chassis that is impervious to most adverse
  environments, including open space. The suit comes equipped with few amenities by default. The Nubian engineers who
  created the Kav-Dann power armor intended for major modifications and upgrades to be made by the buyer, which both
  reduces the expense of the suit and decreases manufacturing time.

  Like many other varieties of powered armor, a Kav-Dann suit is spaceworthy and includes a full life-support suite that
  can be modified for most alien physiologies. A wearer can survive for four hours in a vacuum or unbreathable
  atmosphere, and gains <boost></boost> to checks to resist the effects of radiation. The helmet incorporates the
  long-range comlink and a basic visual package that allows for the wearer to remove <setback></setback> caused by
  darkness, smoke or other environmental factors that might affect vision from all Perception, Vigilance, and Combat
  checks.

  Kav-Dann power armor increases the wearer's Brawn by 1 so long as it remains powered, though this bonus does not
  increase the user's soak or wound threshold. The listed encumbrance of 4 reflects the bulk of the armor when powered.
  If the suit loses power for any reason, the encumbrance increases to 12, defense is reduced to -, and the bonus to
  Brawn is lost. Donning a suit of Kav-Dann power armor takes ten minutes, though this time can be halved if the wearer
  is assisted.
