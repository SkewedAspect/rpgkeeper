name: Chitin Armor
description: >-
  Chitin armor is usually made by hand from the husks of various giant insect species found throughout, the galaxy.
  Essentially a poor person's composite armor, chitin is made by working insect carapaces into protective plates and
  attaching them to a flexible backing. This is typically standard cloth but occasionally more advanced materials like
  mylamesh or the ballistic cloth used in armored bodysuits is used. Each suit of chitin armor is unique. Depending on
  the materials used, a chitin suit can be any color, cut or style imaginable. The creatures whose hides are used in the
  construction of a suit of chitin armor might also offer protective qualities such as the ability to better deflect
  blaster bolts or blend into specific environments.

  Chitin armor makes a strong statement about the wearer and these suits tend to have a startling effect on people in
  civilized society. A character wearing a suit of chitin armor adds automatic <advantage></advantage> to her Coercion
  checks and automatic <threat></threat> on her Charm checks. The Game Master may determine that the armor provides
  further benefits or drawbacks depending on the situation.
