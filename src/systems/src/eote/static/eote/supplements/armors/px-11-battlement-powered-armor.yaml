description: >-
  The PX-11 "Battlement" from Arakyd Industries exemplifies powered armor suits. The PX-11 is a fully-enclosed suit of
  heavy durasteel armor, motivated by synthetic muscle fiber bundles and nano-hydraulics. Despite the armor's weight,
  the powerful mechanical musculature actually increases his strength.

  The suit forms a vacuum-sealed life support system, allowing the wearer to survive in a vacuum or toxic environment
  for up to one hour. The suit's helmet incorporates a comlink as well as sophisticated optical and auditory sensors,
  allowing the wearer to deduct <setback></setback><setback></setback> from all Perception, Surveillance, Vigilance, and
  combat skill checks due to darkness, smoke, or similar environmental factors that obscure vision. PX-11 armor suit
  charge packs supply enough power for 12 hours of use.

  In addition to its protective value, the armor increases the wearer's Brawn by 1 while wearing the armor. This does
  not increase his soak or wound threshold. The wearer also gains +1 rank of the Athletics skill as long as he is
  wearing the armor. The listed encumbrance value assumes the armor is powered. If a Battlement suit loses power or
  ceases to function for any reason, its encumbrance becomes 12, its defense becomes 0, and the wearer loses the Brawn
  increase. Equipping the armor without assistance takes five minutes. Assistance cuts this time in half.
