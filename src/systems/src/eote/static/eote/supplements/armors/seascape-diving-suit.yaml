name: SeaScape Diving Suit
description: >-
  A surprising number of sentients dwell in aquatic environments, far from an oxygen-enriched atmosphere. When air
  breathers must work closely with aquatic species-or travel beneath an ocean's surface for any other reason-a
  self-contained diving suit is required. A good suit must be flexible and comfortable, but it must also provide for the
  user's needs over multiple hours of use.

  The SeaScape diving suit can provide six hours of atmosphere to an air breather. During this time, the wearer also has
  access to fresh water, nutrition supplements, and other biological necessities. While wearing a SeaScape diving suit,
  a character does not suffer movement penalties for traveling through water.
