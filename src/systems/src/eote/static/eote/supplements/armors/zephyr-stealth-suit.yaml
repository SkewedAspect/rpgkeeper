name: Zephyr Stealth Suit
description: >-
  Stealth suits, produced by companies like Ayelixe/Kronbing Textiles and Creshaldyne, are designed to make a wearer
  difficult or impossible to detect by visual or technological means. Constructed from a wide array of materials and
  using technologies such as optical camouflage, silhouette breakers, thermal sinks and sound deadeners, they render a
  wearer nearly invisible under the right circumstances. Zephyr are a common type of such stealth wear for those who
  often perform cover missions, and are favored amongst urban vigilantes, criminals, and industrial spies alike. These
  suits have dark, muted colors with matte-finish hardware and come with gloves boots, and a head garment that covers
  everything but the wearer's eyes.

  A character wearing a zephyr stealth suit upgrades the ability of any Stealth checks she makes once.
