name: Jedi Battle Armor
description: >-
  When the Jedi battled Sith warriors in ancient days, many wore suits of armor to protect themselves from the weapons
  of their enemies.  Crafted by some of the best armorsmiths in the galaxy, these suits of battle armor were extremely
  resistant to cutting edges and baster fire alike. They were also quite cumbersome, and each one was custom forged for
  its wearer. Though hundreds of such suits were made, only a handful have survived to the present day in anything
  resembling usable condition, and all specimens are still fitted to their wearers of old.

  A character wearing Jedi battle armor fitted for somebody else adds <setback></setback><setback></setback> to all
  Combat checks. A suit of Jedi battle armor can be fitted to a new wearer with a Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check that takes an hour to
  complete. Jedi battle armor is eligible to be sealed against the vacuum and other hazardous environments.
