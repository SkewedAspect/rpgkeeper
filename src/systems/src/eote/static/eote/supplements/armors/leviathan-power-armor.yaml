name: Leviathan Power Armor
description: >-
  Designed by the Mon Calamari for use in subaquatic military operations, Leviathan power armor has seen plenty of use
  within the Rebel Alliance. In particular, the Alliance employs Leviathan power armor during operations on aquatic
  Imperial facilities and targets. The armor not only provides protection from the pressure of deep-water operations,
  but acts as a stable weapons platform for its integrated flechette rifle and mini-torpedo launcher.

  Though created for use by Mon Calamari, Leviathan suits can be modified to fit members of other species. More often
  than not, they are created for specific individuals by Mon Cal craftsmen. Much like Mon Calamari starships, each
  Leviathan suit is a unique work of art, and no two suits are identical in appearance.

  Any character wearing a Leviathan suit that was not built for him upgrades the difficulty of Agility and Brawn-based
  checks once.

  A Leviathan suit is fully sealed and has an integrated respirator (see page 195 of the Age of Rebellion Core
  Rulebook). It automatically possesses the following attachments: a heating system, an enhanced optics suite, and a
  strength enhancement system (see page 187 of the Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook). These attachments are already
  installed, and cannot be removed. Each suit is also equipped with one Mon Cal

  Defenses mini torpedo launcher and one Salus DF-D1 duo-flechette rifle.
