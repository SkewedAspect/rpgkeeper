  Kamperdine Clothing Specialists is a small boutique manufacturer of custom clothing items based out of the Core Worlds
  region. Specializing in the use of fine and exotic beast hides, Kamperdine can produce a stylish and rugged piece of
  clothing from the skin of nearly any known creature in the galaxy. Their line of custom tailored armored jackets are
  their most popular and most expensive product. Tailored to each customer's exact specifications, no two of these
  highly sought-after jackets are alike. Kamperdine can create a jacket to perfectly fit nearly any sentient species
  that wears clothes, and their client list is a who's who of politicians, entertainers, military and government
  officials, and various other flavors of galactic VIP. A custom Kamperdine jacket makes an incredible first impression,
  and is a sign that its wearer is an individual of impeccable taste. Kamperdine jackets are rarely found on the open
  market, and most individuals who purchase one go to their graves in them. They must be ordered directly from
  Kamperdine months in advance of their desired delivery date.

  Kamperdine Armored Jackets are each tailored to a specific wearer. When worn by that wearer, they add
  <advantage></advantage> to any successful Charm, Deception, or Negotiation checks the character makes (the GM may
  decide that the bonus does not apply in certain situations, such as dealings over a comlink).
