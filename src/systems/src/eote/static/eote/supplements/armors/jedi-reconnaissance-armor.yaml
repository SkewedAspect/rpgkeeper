description: >-
  In the chaos of a major conflict, may clone troopers fear that the sheer volume of blaster bolts fired from both sides
  could catch even a Jedi Master unprepared. In an effort to ease the concerns of their allies, some Jedi wear
  lightweight armor that offers some protection, while still leaving them largely unencumbered for battle or overland
  travel.

  Characters wearing Jedi reconnaissance armor add <boost></boost> to Stealth checks they make.
