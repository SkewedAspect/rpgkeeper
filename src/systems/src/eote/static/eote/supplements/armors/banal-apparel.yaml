name: Banal Apparel
description: >-
  Stealth equipment can render a person literally invisible to the naked eye, but sometimes simply fading into the crowd
  offers a more elegant and effective solution. Banal apparel is specifically chosen to encourage a wandering eye to
  continue to wander, allowing the wearer to hide in plain sight simply by avoiding attention.

  Opposing characters upgrade the difficulty of any checks made to identify the wearer once.
