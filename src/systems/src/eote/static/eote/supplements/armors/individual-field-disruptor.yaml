name: Individual Field Disruptor
description: >-
  A field disruptor is normally used to disable the shields and potentially the electronic systems on a vehicle or
  starship. An individual field disruptor takes this functionality and brings it to a much smaller scale, enabling it to
  be used against a foe wearing a personal energy field, as well as offering some protection to the wearer. Because of
  its small size-the device is less than ten centimeters in diameter and is typically clipped to a belt-the individual
  field disruptor is relatively discreet. When not activated, a casual observer might mistake it for a sensor or even a
  simple piece of ornamentation.

  In  use, the field disruptor creates a shimmering field around the wearer, forming a two-meter in diameter sphere
  around the device and individual while obscuring visibility of the wearer. Whenever this field comes in contact with
  an energy shield, it immediately deactivates it.

  If the field of a disruptor contacts another energy field, the other field ceases to offer any defense as long as the
  two fields intersect. If a character wearing an active field enters engaged range with a droid, the droid suffers 5
  Stun damage. If the field enters engaged range with any other electronic device, the device shorts out and becomes
  inactive for the remainder of the encounter. If the wearer makes a melee attack while the field is active, the wearer
  counts as being armed with a Melee weapon with +2 damage and the Stun Damage item quality.
