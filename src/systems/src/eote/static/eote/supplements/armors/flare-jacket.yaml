name: Flare Jacket
description: >-
  Originally designed by a high-end clothes manufacturer for making literally flashy entrances, some organizations saw
  potential military use and contracted Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles to produce a more intense version of their Personal
  Defense coat. Concealing several small charges in seams throughout the design, the jacket can release a blinding and
  stunning flash of light, allowing the wearer a few seconds to make an escape. The internal power source is small, and
  thus can take several minutes to recharge after each use.

  Once per encounter, a character wearing a flare jacket can trigger the charges as a maneuver. Each character within
  short range (besides the wearer) must make a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Vigilance check**. Each character who
  fails is staggered for 1 round, plus 1 additional round per <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat>.

  **Models include:** Ayelixe/Krongbing Personal Defense Coat, Brennkeyes Syndicate flare jacket.
