  Polis Masson Bodysuit


  The Polis Massans employ unique, tight-fitting bodysuits in their day-to-day lives. Not only do the suits provide some
  incidental protection from physical damage, but they also supply a number of load- bearing pockets, clips, and straps
  to keep important equipment close at hand.


  All Polis Massan bodysuits include a tiny head- mounted multidirectional glow rod, as well as an integrated utility
  belt (which increases the wearer’s encumbrance by 1). Though designed with Polis Massan physiology in mind, bodysuits
  for use by other species have been commissioned.
