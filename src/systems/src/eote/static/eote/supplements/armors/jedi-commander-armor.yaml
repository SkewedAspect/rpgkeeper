name: Jedi Commander Armor
description: >-
  The traditional robes of the Jedi are appropriate for their work as mediators and peacekeepers, but when leading
  detachments of clone troopers, many Jedi have opted for additional protection to fit their new role. Although there is
  no standard-issue Jedi armor, Republic armorers working with the Jedi Temple have modified clone trooper suits to meet
  the needs of the Jedi generals on several occasions.

  The most important laminate plates of the armor are fitted over a loose robe to make a garment that offers vital
  protection in battle without compromising acrobatic lightsaber forms and Force-assisted maneuvers.

  The silhouette and exact systems of the armor vary based on the Jedi commissioning the modifications, but the basic
  designs are similar enough that the so-called "Jedi commander armor" is a recognizable sight across the battlefields
  of the Clone Wars.
