name: Mechanic's Utility Suit
description: >-
  Not so much armor as an adaptation applied to the rugged clothing common to Technicians on the go, a utility suit is
  bedecked with pockets, attachment hooks, and gear straps. The shape of the suit varies based on the creator, although
  retail models tend to resemble dusters or trenchcoats over a pocket-festooned apron.

  The wearer counts as having a tool kit (see pages 181-182 of the **Edge of The Empire Core Rulebook**).
