name: Ancient Battle Armor
description: >-
  The precursors of the ancient Jedi faced much more primitive weapons than lightsabers and blasters, and so found heavy
  combat armor to be more worthwhile than did later generations. Although most such suits were destroyed in battle or by
  the passage of the millennia, on rare occasions, archaeologists or construction droids uncover ancient suits of metal
  armor in buried or forgotten ruins. With generous cleaning and repair work, this kind of ancient armor can prove
  serviceable, if heavy and burdensome. Some claim that such armor is effective against even modern blasters when worn
  by an individual strong in the Force, although weapon developers and metallurgists dismiss such stories.

  While worn by a character with a Force rating of 1 or higher, ancient battle armor gains Defense 1.
