description: >-
  Most sets of crash gear consist of an assortment of protective wears designed to allow a user to better survive the
  inevitable collisions and buffeting that are part of every race or mission. Typical outerwear includes layers of
  microfiber cloth and impact-absorbing gel inserts worked into a jumpsuit or other form-fitting outfit, along with
  thick gloves and boots. Most importantly, crash gear comes with protective headwear. These can range from small
  skullcaps (known colloquially as "skid lids") to full-face, internally supported, environmentally sealed helmets that
  can rival military gear. Like crash gear outerwear, crash helmets include gel-packs and wicking microfiber but also
  have strong polycarbonate shells lined with dense polyfoam for greater protection. Some helmets are also equipped with
  integral face shields or flip-up visors that are tinted and polarized to protect the wearer's eyes from  both debris
  and flaring lights.

  A character wearing crash gear ignores the effects of ongoing Critical Injuries on any Intellect or Cunning related
  checks but still suffers from the injuries themselves. She also cannot be disorientated.
