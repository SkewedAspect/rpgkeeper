description: >-
  Another offering from the utilitarians at the Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles Corporation, the Mountaineer is a suit of
  light, flexible armor designed to assist the wearer in climbing and navigating mountainous terrain. Made from a thick,
  tear-resistant textile with excellent thermal-retention qualities and interwoven with a patented foil-fiber armor
  weave, Mountaineer armor provides good protection from impacts, abrasions, and falls. In addition to the armor weave,
  the suit is reinforced at the shoulders, knees, and elbows with impact-absorbing polymer pads and is equipped with an
  integral climbing and support harness. The palms of the gloves and soles of the light, flexible boots are coated in
  FrictionGrip, a material produced by A/KT that adheres to even the smoothest surface. The entire suit consists of the
  one-piece jumpsuit, gloves, boots, and a helmet. Accessories like oxygen tanks for high-altitude climbing can be added
  for a nominal fee, and all attachments for such accessories are already integrated into the armor.

  Mountaineer armor grants the wearer <boost></boost><boost></boost> to all Athletics skill checks made to climb or
  rappel.
