name: Protector 1 Combat Armor
description: The Protector 1 from the Tagge Company is representative of an entire class of heavy battle armor,
  consisting of strong durasteel plates over a ballistic mesh suit. The armor plates of the Protector 1 are not as
  all-encompassing as some suits of battle armor, trading a negligible amount of protection for increased mobility and
  lighter weight than similar armor suits. The positions of the plates distribute weight evenly, and the mesh-weave
  visible between the plates is still resistant to glancing hits. Overall, many mercenaries and soldiers find the
  Protector 1 to be an ideal trade-off between protection and mobility.
