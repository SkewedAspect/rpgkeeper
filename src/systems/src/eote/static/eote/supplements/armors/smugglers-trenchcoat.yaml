name: Smuggler's Trenchcoat
description: >-
  Every smuggler gets searched; that part of the job is inevitable. Some smugglers, however, take the tact that if they
  simply have enough hidden compartments, at least a few will inevitably go unsearched. The smuggler's trenchcoat
  addresses this strategy, and is covered with pockets, minor compartments, and pouches within pouches to confound any
  search.

  Checks made to find anything hidden within a smuggler's trenchcoat while it is being worn are opposed by the
  Skulduggery of the wearer. The coat can conceal up to 2 encumbrance worth of items.
