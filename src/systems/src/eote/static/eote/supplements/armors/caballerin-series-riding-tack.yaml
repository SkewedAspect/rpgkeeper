description: >-
  No matter how tame and biddable a creature is, and how much a rider believes he can trust his mount, a good set of
  riding tack is an indispensable part of a beast rider's accoutrement. Made in a variety of styles for nearly every
  known beast able to be domesticated in the galaxy, Piccatech Ltd.'s Caballerin-series beast tack is the industry
  leader in beast-riding equipment. A full set of riding tack includes a sturdy saddle tailored to both the beast and
  the type of riding expected, stirrups, headgear (bridle, halter, bit, etc), and breastplate. If the tack is purchased
  for a working animal as opposed to a riding animal, a harness is substituted for the saddle, and allows a creature to
  pull or carry vast amounts of cargo.

  Tack can only be equipped to bestial riding animals. Using it allows the character to ride the beast without suffering
  the bareback riding penalties discussed on page 81.
