description: >-
  This category of armor covers light vests, jackets, or pants plated with plastoid or ceramic pads, sometimes with mesh
  energy-dispersion layers. This armor type is very light but covers the most important vital organs. These plates are
  mostly undetectable as long as the clothing is reasonably bulky. An **Average
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Perception check** detects that a person's clothing is plated.

  However, the plates woven into the fabric do not just provide absorption against blows, they also serve to deflect
  some shots away from vital areas entirely.

  **Models Include:** Tenloss Syndicate "ShadowStalker" Assassin Gear.
