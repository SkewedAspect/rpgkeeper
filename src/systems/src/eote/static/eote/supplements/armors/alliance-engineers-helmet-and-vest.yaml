name: Alliance Engineer's Helmet and Vest
description: >-
  Similar to helmets worn by civilian engineers and construction workers, an Alliance engineer's helmet is made of
  sturdy, lightweight, fiber-reinforced polycarbonate and fitted with a shock-absorbing gel liner. They can be equipped
  with an optional flexible visor to protect the face and eyes from flying debris. These helmets are usually worn in
  conjunction with similarly sturdy protective vests made of reinforced cloth. While such helmet and vests are perhaps
  not the most effective armor, they have been known to turn a blaster bolt or shrapnel from a grenade.

  While wearing an Alliance engineer's helmet and vest, the character counts as having 1 rank (or one additional rank)
  in the Durable talent.
