description: >-
  Piccatech's H-series megafauna carriage is an essential piece of kit for those working with oversized creatures. Known
  colloquially as a howdah, at its most basic the H-series megafauna carriage is little more than a broad platform that
  straps to the back of a large creature. They come in a range of sizes, can be built to fit nearly any large beast, and
  can be built to carry passengers, cargo, or a combination thereof. A variety of options are offered for the H-series,
  including different rails and safety features, canopies, environmentally sealed enclosures, or nearly anything else a
  customer might desire.

  A beast must have a silhouette of at least 3 and a Brawn of at least 5 to be fitted with a howdah. Basic howdah
  configurations are readily available for beasts with a tetrapodal or quadrupedal stance, like the fambaa or dewback,
  at the listed price. Howdahs for creatures with more appendages, like the six-legged acklay, can be had for a small
  additional fee, generally 500 credits. Howdahs can be armored and fitted with one or two Gunnery or vehicle-scale
  weapons, following the usual restrictions for silhouette as outlined on page 287 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core
  Rulebook.

  A megafauna carriage can only be equipped to bestial riding animals. In addition to its other effects, using it allows
  the character to ride the beast without suffering the bareback riding penalties discussed on page 81.
