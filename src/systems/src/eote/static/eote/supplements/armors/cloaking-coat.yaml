description: >-
  While spies, thieves and saboteurs favor more expensive personal stealth fields and similar devices, a skilled Slicer
  typically considers staying unnoticed by sensors and probes to be the most important part of breaking through
  security. After all, if the slicer runs into organic guards in person, something has already gone dramatically wrong
  elsewhere in the planned operation or heist. To avoid automated detection measures, any Slicers invest in or construct
  cloaking coats. These heavy, full-body suits are outfitted with jamming suites designed to mask the wearer's presence
  from detection. A cloaking coat's sensors and automated systems keep the wearer hidden by constantly broadcasting an
  obscuring cloud of junk data. this specialized array does nothing to stop visual recognition but it can baffle almost
  any scanner. A skilled Sliver can even modify the clouding signal it broadcasts on the fly to confuse droid brains
  into disregarding the wearer as background data rather than as a being of any note.

  Upgrade the difficulty of all checks to detect an individual wearing a cloaking coat using sensors or electronic forms
  of detection twice. Droids with an Intellect characteristic lower than the character's ranks in the Computers skill
  are also affected in the same way when trying to detect the character.
