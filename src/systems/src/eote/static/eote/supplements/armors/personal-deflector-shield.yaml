name: Personal Deflector Shield
description: >-
  Though rare, bulky, and difficult to use, personal deflector shields are one of the few defenses that can stand up to
  blaster fire. Deflector shields use limited ray/particle shielding that deflects and blocks incoming projectiles. They
  are difficult to use because the power drain is extraordinary, meaning they only work for a limited length of time.
  When the wielder is using a personal deflector shield, the GM can spend any <despair></despair> the wielder generates
  to have the shield run out of power for the remainder of the encounter.

  The shield has enough power to last about ten minutes. Recharging a deflector shield requires three hours and
  electrical facilities.

  Modern galactic companies do not generally produce personal deflector shields. The technology to make one that does
  not emit enough radiation to kill an organic user is very rare, and those that exist are almost always custom-built.
