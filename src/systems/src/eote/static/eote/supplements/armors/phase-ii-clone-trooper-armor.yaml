name: Phase II Clone Trooper Armor
description: >-
  Throughout the course of the Clone Wars, clone troopers have assumed a broad range of different battlefield roles. It
  has become increasingly obvious that the armor employed at the start of the conflict was insufficiently adaptable to
  the varying requirements of these roles. To remedy this situation, the Grand Army of the Republic gradually rolled out
  a new model of armor to all clone troopers.

  The new armor incorporates a much greater level of modularity and adaptability so that individual clones can modify it
  as best suits their preferences and requirements. These improvements necessitate some cutbacks in basic systems,
  including the removal of the armor's internal life-support system. Modular components are available to replace all
  omitted functions, so clone troopers can always reconfigure their armor to incorporate those features necessary for a
  particular battlefield role.

  Phase II clone trooper armor includes an integrated comlink with scrambler capable of using all standard Republic
  communications protocols.
