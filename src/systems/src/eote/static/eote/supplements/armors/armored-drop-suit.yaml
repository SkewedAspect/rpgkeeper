name: Armored Drop Suit
description: >-
  Mobility is often a decisive element in any engagement. Combatants from common killers-for-hire to Imperial
  stormtroopers know that taking a good position and controlling the flow of combat can be better protection than a
  durasteel blast door. Most armor designs factor this in to some degree, foregoing absolutely maximized plating or
  coverage to allow normal mobility, but a few suits go above and beyond the concept of allowing “normal mobility.”

  Armored drop suits are a type of light laminate body armor constructed around a powerful repulsorift unit,

  allowing the wearer to fly between firing positions or

  spots of cover, or to rain down attacks from above.

  The arrangement of fabric and composite plating of

  the armor in such suits minimizes air resistance and

  improves maneuverability, while still offering respectable protection against incoming fire.

  As a maneuver, the wearer of an armored drop suit

  can engage his flight systems to function as a Silhouette 0, Speed 2, Handling + 2, System Strain Threshold 5 vehicle
  that; requires Piloting [Planetary] to

  operate. Further, while the flight systems are engaged

  and the wearer is conscious to guide himself down, he

  does not suffer damage from falling.
