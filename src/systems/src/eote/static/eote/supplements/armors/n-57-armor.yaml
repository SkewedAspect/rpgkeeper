  Merr-Sonn N-57 Armor

  The latest suit in Merr-Sonn's N-series armor for combat engineers has broken with the company's typical policy of
  selling exclusively to established planetary militaries and is available for general purchase on the open market.
  unrest across the galaxy has made everyone from Rebel saboteurs to civilian contractors in dangerous areas interested
  in a little extra protection as they work. Fortunately, combat engineering armor exists to meet their needs. In
  addition to providing protection comparable to laminate armor, the suit also includes a microgenerator that can be
  used to power attachments or provide an emergency boost to external equipment.

  As a maneuver, the wearer may recharge an energy weapon or device that has run out of power or ammunition in the
  manner of an extra reload/power pack (see page 181 pf the **Edge of The Empire Core Rulebook**).
