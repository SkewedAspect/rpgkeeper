name: A/KT Wing Commander Armored Flight Suit
description: >-
  The popular Wing Commander armored flight suit by Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles Corporation is the latest word in pilot
  comfort and protection. Similar to the Shockrider crash suit, the Wing Commander is built of sturdy synthetic textiles
  reinforced with a thick, energy-dispersing foil-fiber armorweave. In addition to the armorweave, the Wing Commander
  features thin ferro-ceramic armor plates and impact-absorbing gel inserts to protect delicate areas. The suit also
  features a sophisticated life support system that performs well in both atmosphere and space, and can be sealed to the
  gloves, boots, and helmet to form an ersatz space suit in case of emergency. To top off their protective features,
  Wing Commander suits are also treated with a fire-and-radiation-proof chemical to help wearers survive vehicle fires.

  Thanks to its rugged construction and integrated armor, the Wing Commander suit reduces any strain received from
  Critical Hits dealt to the wearer's vehicle by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and the flame-resistant coating reduces damage
  dealt to the wearer by fires and weapons with the Burn quality by 1.
