name: Sith Pain Harness
description: >-
  Constant enemies of the Jedi Order, the Sith have always sought to dominate and destroy. They even seek to pervert the
  Force itself, turning its energies into a weapon to torture and maim. They build all their greatest strengths on the
  pain they can inflict.

  Developed over generations, the Sith Pain Harness represents the pinnacle of this philosophy. It is little more than a
  set of interlocking metal plates, each sharp enough to easily draw blood. Any being wearing the armor must take
  extreme caution, lest the metal carve into their flesh. Granted, the point of the device is not to avoid hurting
  oneself. Instead, Sith are to embrace the pain, using it to fuel their hatred. The pain they feel suffuses all their
  Force power, a gruesome attempt to spread their own agony.

  While wearing the Sith Pain Harness, a character can choose to suffer one wound as an incidental to add automatic
  <success></success> to the next Discipline check they make during the current round. They then suffer 1 Conflict.
