  VeTech AniPro Layered Beast Armor

  Light and easy to maintain, the AniPro-series  layered beast armor by VeTech strikes a good balance between protection
  and practicality. Somewhat similar to light armor suits worn by many of the galaxy's law enforcement officers, it is
  made from thick layers of synthetic fibers reinforced with lengths of energy absorbing armorweave. This material is
  backed with thin polycarbonate plates at strategic locations on an animal's neck, shoulders, back and leg. Thanks to
  its design and lightweight construction, AniPro armor doesn't weigh an animal down or restrict its speed or range
  motion, making it easy to wear for extended lengths of time.

  AniPro beast armor can only be worn by riding or working animals. In addition to providing protection to a mount, this
  armor allows a character to ride the animal without suffering the bareback riding penalties detailed on page 73.
