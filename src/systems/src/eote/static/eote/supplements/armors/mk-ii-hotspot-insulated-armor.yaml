name: Mk II "Hotspot" Insulated Armor
description: >-
  Flame troopers are among the more specialized units in the Grand Army of the Republic. They are equipped with flame
  projectors and protective gear designed to help them flush enemies from their defenses and clear areas of dangerous
  flora or contaminants in hostile environments. Their armor, specially designed to assist them in their role, features
  a heavily filtered respirator unit and significant thermal shielding to insulate them from the effects of their own
  weaponry. The current model of flame trooper armor is the Mk II “Hotspot” design of insulated armor, a substantial
  improvement over the initial Mk I design issued at the very outset of the war. The first designs for “Hotspot” armor
  lacked sufficient respirator filtration, risking the wearer through exposure to toxic smoke and air deprived of
  adequate oxygen due to the flames. The flawed design was an oversight due to the rushed production needs of both the
  Republic and the Kaminoans. The flaw was corrected as quickly as could be managed, and the newly issued Mk II suits
  have been a source of significantly improved morale among the flame trooper corps.

  Mk II “Hotspot” insulated armor comes with a built-in comlink. It adds <boost></boost><boost></boost> to the wearer's
  checks to avoid adverse effects from exposure to extreme heat or toxic gases and reduces the damage the wearer takes
  from fire and hazardous environments by 1. Additionally, when targeting the wearer, attackers must spend one
  additional <advantage></advantage> to activate the Burn item quality and treat the quality's rating as one lower.
