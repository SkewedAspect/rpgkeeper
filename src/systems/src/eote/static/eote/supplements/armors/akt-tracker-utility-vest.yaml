description: >-
  Common among outdoorsmen, scouts, and hunters, the Tracker Utility Vest from Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles Corporation is
  the Explorer's best friend. These vests are simple sleeveless garments worn on the torso and made from lightweight,
  durable, stain-resistant, tear-resistant synthetic textiles that close in front with a heavy-duty zipper. They are
  covered with numerous pouches of various size, shape, and utility, which are all connected to an integral load-bearing
  system concealed beneath the vest's lining. When fully zipped, the garment distributes the weight of anything carried
  in its pouches evenly and effectively across the wearers body, allowing the wearer to carry his important tools and
  items where he can reach them quickly and without them weighing him down overmuch or getting in his way.

  When worn, the Tracker utility vest increases the wearer's encumbrance threshold by 2.
