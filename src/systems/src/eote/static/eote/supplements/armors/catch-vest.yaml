description: >-
  Worn by many Corellians who live on the fringe, the innocuous catch vest has saved the lives of many free traders.
  Made of tightly woven energy-absorbing fibers, the catch vest is able to partially diffuse blaster shots.
  Indistinguishable from regular clothing, the catch vest is an excellent choice for those wishing to add some extra
  protection without advertising the fact.

  Catch vests have a soak value of 2 against damage from energy-based weapons only; they provide only 1 point of soak
  against all other forms of damage.
