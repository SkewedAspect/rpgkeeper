name: Verpine Fiber Ultramesh Armor
description: >-
  Fiber ultramesh armor is the standard armor worn by Verpine colony guards. It is a more advanced version of Verpine
  fiber mesh armor, with a tighter weave and sturdier construction. Ultramesh is provided as a flexible bodysuit, rather
  than as a single torso piece. It gains exceptional rigidity when exposed to an electric current, which is provided by
  a diminutive battery pack.

  The Verpine have been exporting fiber mesh and fiber ultramesh armor for centuries, making it a relatively common
  sight on Outer Rim worlds. Alliance agents appreciate the versatility of being able to switch between a comfortable
  set of armor to a more protective, albeit less comfortable set at the push of a button.

  As a maneuver, the wearer may power up or power down the armor. While the armor is powered up, the wearer gains +2
  defense. However, any character may spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> or <triumph></triumph> from a
  Combat check against the character to cause it to run out of power; the armor becomes powered down and cannot be
  powered up until the end of the encounter.
