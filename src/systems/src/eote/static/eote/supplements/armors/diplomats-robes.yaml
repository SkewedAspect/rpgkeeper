description: >-

  is a person of importance. Other characters often become more cautious or polite when interacting with the wearer,
  sometimes allowing the diplomat to access restricted areas and information.

  A character wearing diplomat's robes adds <boost></boost> to social checks related to claiming diplomatic authority,
  accessing classified data, and using organizational status to bypass normal protocol.
