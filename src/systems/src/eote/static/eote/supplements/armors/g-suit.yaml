description: G-suits, or gravity suits, are special garments worn under flight suits by pilots and racers who are
  regularly exposed to high g-forces, such as those experienced while racing or performing, aggressive aerobatics.
  G-suits use inflatable bladders, pressurized gel pockets, and compression garments to keep pilots' blood from pooling
  in their lower extremities, causing a dangerous condition known as g-LOC (g-induced loss of consciousness) which
  occurs when the brain is deprived of blood. G-suits pilots to  push their ships or vehicles further and operate them
  more aggressively without fear of blacking out. A character wearing a g-suit reduces the strain cost to perform a
  second Pilot Only maneuver during a turn by 1.
