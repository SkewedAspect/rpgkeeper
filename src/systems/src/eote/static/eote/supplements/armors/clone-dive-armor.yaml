name: Clone Dive Armor
description: >-
  Some battlefronts are on worlds such as Mon Cala, where clone troopers must fight while swimming through the depths.
  Clones are as ill suited for such environments as any other humans and they require armor that protects them from the
  ocean's pressure while also providing breathable air and assisting with aquatic maneuverability. By necessity, these
  suits are made of lighter-weight materials so that the wearer retains some degree of buoyancy. They also incorporate
  an underwater propulsion system, fins, and sensors for underwater visibility.

  Clone dive armor provides twelve hours of oxygen. During this time, the wearer also has fresh water, nutrition
  supplements, and other biological necessities. While wearing clone dive armor, a character does not suffer movement
  penalties for moving through water and removes up to one <setback></setback> from Perception checks due to underwater
  conditions.
