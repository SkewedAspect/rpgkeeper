name: Heavy Robes
description: Many Jedi wear thick robes, sometimes with ceremonial significance, and sometimes simply to protect
  themselves against the elements in the course of their work. These robes are little more than layers of reinforced
  fabrics, largely incapable of stopping incoming attacks, but the voluminous profile they provide can offer limited
  protection by obscuring vital areas or even a Jedi's general silhouette.
