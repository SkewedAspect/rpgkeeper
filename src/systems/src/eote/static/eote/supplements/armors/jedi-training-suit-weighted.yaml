name: Jedi Training Suit (Weighted)
description: >-
  The armor utilized by Jedi Padawans in training was far from functional, but it still shows up occasionally,
  especially in the possession of lose students who have lost their masters. The typical training suit features bulky,
  heavily padded chest, leg and arm pieces designed to absorb the stunning blows of training lightsabers. Training suits
  also incorporate weights in their major components so that learners can get used to the effects armor has on their
  mobility.

  Jedi training suits were a common sight in the Jedi temple, often accompanied by WJ-880 blinding helmets. Padawans in
  the early phases of their training were made to wear their suits on a daily basis. The constant weight of the suit
  helped physically strengthen the Jedi-to-be. Most training suits incorporated bright colors so their purpose as a
  training tool was obvious. These colors were also used to differentiate teams of Padawans during group training.

  Unless the integrated weights are removed, a Jedi training suit has an encumbrance of 6. Removal of these weights,
  which requires which requires an Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check, reduces the suit's encumbrance to
  4. At the GM's discretion, training while wearing the weights might help a character develop physical fitness or adapt
  to high-gravity environments.
