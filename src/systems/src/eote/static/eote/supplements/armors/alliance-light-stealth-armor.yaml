name: Alliance Light Stealth Armor
description: >-
  The inferior numbers and resources of the Alliance

  military force rebel soldiers to rely on stealth and subterfuge to accomplish most of their missions. Unfortunately,
  cutting-edge Imperial sensors can often detect

  life forms and energy signatures from conventional

  blaster weaponry, making some infiltration missions

  impossible. Rebel soldiers have sometimes acquired

  functioning storm commando armor, but stealing

  from the enemy is not an especially reliable means

  of resupplying. That is why Alliance R&D reverse-engineered the technology behind storm commando

  armor and developed their own, albeit lower-grade,

  stealth armor. Most Alliance stealth armor is retrofitted Mk II Clone Trooper armor left over from the

  final days of the Republic sprayed in various camouflage patterns or matte black. A coating of specialized

  material absorbs some light and sound waves, making

  it easier for marines and special forces troops to move

  about unnoticed by sensors and sentries.

  This armor adds <boost></boost> to the wearer’s Stealth checks.
