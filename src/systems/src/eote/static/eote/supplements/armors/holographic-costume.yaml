description: >-
  When unpowered, the holographic suit is a slightly glossy, unremarkable, form-fitting suit. A small control panel on
  the inside left sleeve activates numerous miniaturized holoprojectors, sheathing the wearer in a convincing facsimile
  of one of several preselected outfits. The holographic costume does not hide or alter the appearance of the wearer,
  but it does enable the wearer to switch between any of ten preloaded outfits with a simple flick of the controls. The
  recorder built into the suit enables a user to overwrite preloaded outfits with new designs, a process that takes
  roughly ten minutes.

  To record a new outfit, a character must make an **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Computers check** while in
  possession of a garment to be recorded, or a **Daunting
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Computers
  check** to create a facsimile of a garment that is not on hand.

  **Models include:** A/KT "Versatility" Outfit, Plescinia Micro Holo Suit.
