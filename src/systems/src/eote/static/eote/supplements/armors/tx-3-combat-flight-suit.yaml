name: TX-3 Combat Flight Suit
description: An armored flight suit manufactured by Corellian Technologies primarily for starfighter pilots, the TX-3 is
  used by the CDF and several other system defense forces, and is also popular with pirates, mercenaries, and bounty
  hunters. Similar to the combat flight suits worn by Imperial pilots, the TX-3 provides slightly better protection from
  the vacuum of space, as well as moderate defense from concussive and energy attacks. The fibers in the suit provide
  decent protection from the extreme cold and radiation a pilot is likely to experience in deep space. Without an
  external oxygen source, a person wearing a TX-3 flight suit can survive for up to 24 hours in hard vacuum.
