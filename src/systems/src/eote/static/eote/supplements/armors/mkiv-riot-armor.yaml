description: >-
  The Mk.IV Riot Armor is one of Creshaldyne Industries' most popular offerings. Sold almost exclusively to governmental
  and law enforcement agencies, this sophisticated riot armor is advertised as the final word in protection for law
  enforcement officers. Worn over a smartmesh body glove woven with foil-fiber reinforcement, the armor is composed of a
  lightweight clamshell to protect the torso and a number of flexible contoured plates to protect the legs, groin, arms,
  and shoulders. A blast helmet with a removable, polarized face shield and integrated breath mask completes the
  ensemble.

  This armor includes a breath mask that allows the user to filter out and ignore airborne toxins and gases (but not
  breathe in atmospheres without the character's required atmosphere mix). In addition, when staggered or disoriented,
  the wearer reduces the duration of the effect by one round, to a minimum of one round.
