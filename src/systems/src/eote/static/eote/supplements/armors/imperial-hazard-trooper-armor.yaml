name: Imperial Hazard Trooper Armor
description: >-
  Imperial stormtroopers have specialized armor for

  nearly every situation, and the Imperial hazardous

  environment protective armor, or "hazard trooper

  armor,” is one of the most rugged armor suits in the

  corps. Using a powered armor frame similar to that

  of space troopers, hazard trooper armor augments

  the strength of the wearer and provides protection

  against radiation, acids and toxic chemicals, and

  extreme pressures or vacuums. Movement in the armor is sluggish due to its bulk, but a neural interface

  with the wearer's cybernetics reduces response time

  to a minimum, ensuring marksmanship is unimpeded

  by the armor. While manufactured by the Empire for

  its exclusive use, hazard trooper armor often finds its

  way into the hands of the Rebel Alliance.

  Hazard troopers are known for their incredible

  strength, but this actually stems from the troopers

  standard cybernetic enhancements rather than any

  quality of the armor. More than a few rebel operatives have been disappointed to discover this fact

  after claiming a set of hazard trooper armor in battle.

  Once active, the armor’s internal life support and

  power systems allow the wearer to survive in radiation zones, toxic environments, and total vacuums for

  up to twenty-four hours. The armor also incorporates

  a high-powered comlink able to communicate from

  the ground to low orbit. The helmet is equipped with

  a multi-frequency targeting and acquisition system

  which removes <setback></setback><setback></setback> due to darkness, smoke, or similar environmental factors that
  obscure vision from the

  wearer’s Perception, Vigilance, and combat checks.
