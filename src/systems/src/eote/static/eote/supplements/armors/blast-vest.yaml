name: Blast Vest
description: >-
  Light armor designed to protect the wearer from bullets and flying debris, militia and planetary defense forces
  commonly wear blast vests, as do troopers and crewmen aboard starships. Protecting just the torso of the wearer, blast
  vests leave the limbs uncovered, allowing for unhindered freedom of movement. While the vest provides excellent
  protection from flying debris, shrapnel, and projectile weapons, the materials are not designed to stop energy blasts,
  providing minimal defense against blasters and other energy weapons.

  The armor gains +2 soak when the wearer suffers damage from a slugthrower or other physical projectile.
