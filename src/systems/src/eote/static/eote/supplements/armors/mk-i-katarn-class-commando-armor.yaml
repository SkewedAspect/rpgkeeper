  Mk I Katarn-class Commando Armor

  Katarn-class armor was originally designed for use by clone commandos during the Clone Wars. Named for a dangerous
  predatory beast native to Kashyyyk, this is one of the most advanced suits of heavy combat armor ever produced.

  Each set of armor consists of a fully enclosed, environmentally sealed duraplast suit worn over an insulated,
  breathable, ballistic-fiber bodysuit. The armor is effective against most portable infantry weapons, light ordnance,
  shrapnel, and even light vehicle-mounted weapons like autoblasters and light laser cannons. It is resistant to heat,
  cold, toxins, radiation, and other hazardous environments and features reinforcements at strategic points such as the
  neck, spine, and forearms to protect against blasts and impacts. The helmet is equipped with an integrated combat
  scanner, an encrypted communications suite, and an on-board combat computer that monitors the physical conditions of
  the wearer and any nearby allies wearing Katarn-class armor. It also has an integrated breath mask and an on-board
  oxygen supply good for six hours of heavy combat.

  In addition to its numerous on-board systems, Katarn-class armor can be equipped with a modular backpack system that
  can be tailored to various battlefield roles. Special plug-in modules provide long-range comms, medpacs, extended
  oxygen supplies, and even power generation.

  A full suit of Katarn-class armor provides a wearer with all the benefits of a combat scanner and a breath mask, and
  increases the wearer's encumbrance threshold by 3. In addition, the suit's systems remove <setback></setback> from all
  Perception and Survival checks made by the wearer.
