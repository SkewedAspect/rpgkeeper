  Armour

  Imperial stormtroopers wear fully-enclosed plastoid armor that deflects and negates incoming damage. It won't stop a
  direct hit from a blaster, but is reasonably effective against indirect concussive damage and shrapnel. It typically
  includes vision magnification and integrated comlinks to others attuned to the same frequency. As the armor is
  designed to work with powered systems, it can be easily modified with after-market attachments.

  Laminate armor is worn over a tight-fitting body glove. This system offers significant insulation, making it easier to
  operate in all environments. For extended service in extreme environments, more specialized versions are made.

  **Models Include:** Imperial Department of Military Research Stormtrooper Armor.
