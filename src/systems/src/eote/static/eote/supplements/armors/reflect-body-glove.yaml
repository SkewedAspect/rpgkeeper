name: Reflect Body Glove
description: >-
  Effective body armor is conspicuous. Good armor certainly provides an intimidation factor in addition to security, but
  it risks setting the wrong tone for a tenuous negotiation. For those times when appearances are as important as
  security, armor that is much less noticeable-even if it is less protective-is a necessary compromise.

  A reflect body glove is a skintight suit that can be worn underneath traditional garments. It incorporates a
  reflective weave that is capable of dispersing the blasts from an energy weapon. The thin layer of tight weave is
  fragile, however, particularly for suit of armor.

  Add <setback></setback><setback></setback> to Vigilance and Perception checks to notice that the wearer is wearing a
  reflect body glove. After a successful combat check has been resolved against the wearer, the reflect body glove's
  soak is reduced by one, to a minimum of zero. The reflect body glove's soak may be restored to its original value by
  making a successful **Average (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check**.
