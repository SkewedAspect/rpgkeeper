name: Resplendent Robes
description: >-
  Some beings naturally become the center of attention when they enter a room, but dressing for the part never hurts,
  either. Purposefully ostentatious clothing greatly aids their efforts, allowing the wearer's allies to go about other
  business unobserved.

  As long as a character wearing resplendent robes purposefully draws attention to himself, each of his allies in medium
  range adds <boost></boost> to Perception, Skulduggery, and Stealth checks.
