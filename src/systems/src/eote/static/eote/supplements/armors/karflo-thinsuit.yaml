  Used by professional scouts, science labs, and special

  forces the galaxy over, the thinsuit by Karflo Corporation is among the most popular environmental protection gear
  around. While most protective equipment

  specializes in keeping the wearer safe from exposure

  to a particular environmental condition, the thinsuit

  provides protection against a wide variety of dangerous environments without hampering movement or

  slowing reaction speeds. Despite the fact that it grants

  minimal protection against blasters and other armaments, the ease of transporting it makes it a popular

  addition to the kit of many elite combat units. Made

  from a proprietary material that regulates internal

  conditions while blocking external ones, the thinsuit

  protects from dangerous temperatures, pressure,

  radiation, chemicals, and partial vacuums.

  The thinsuit is a skin-tight body glove, weighing only

  one kilogram, which provides total coverage for standard humanoids, leaving only the face exposed. The

  suit comes with a facemask and filtration system that

  purifies standard atmosphere for up to six hours and

  provides one hour of internal power. The stock suit

  comes with six removable filters and power packs,

  easily stored in the thinsuit’s many pockets.
