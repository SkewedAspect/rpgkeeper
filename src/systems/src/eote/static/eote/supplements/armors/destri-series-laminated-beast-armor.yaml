name: Destri-Series Laminated Beast Armor
description: >-
  Piccatech's Destri-series beast armor uses modern armor technology to provide unparalleled protection for working and
  riding beasts. It uses the same kinds of hard laminate composites used to make heavy battle armor and the famous
  laminate armor worn by Imperial Navy Stormtroopers. Sold in a dizzying variety of styles, Destri armor commonly
  includes articulated laminate plate armor for a creature's head, neck, back, chest, and legs. In addition to the
  protection, the armor is designed with mounting points for saddles, tack, panniers, and other various equipment. The
  armored plates are lined with a shock-absorbing coating, and the entire set is designed to distribute the weight of
  the armor. Destri armor is not a fully sealed suit and does not protect against chemical agents, radiation, or
  environmental conditions, but it does offer excellent protection against light blaster fire, projectiles, and
  shrapnel.

  Destri armor is relatively heavy, and although it's designed to be as easy as possible on the beast wearing it, the
  armor still necessarily restricts movement and tends to make a creature slower. Beasts wearing Destri-series beast
  armor have their Agility reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

  Laminate beast armor can only be equipped to bestial riding animals. In addition to its other effects, using it allows
  the character to ride the beast without suffering the bareback riding penalties discussed on page 81.
