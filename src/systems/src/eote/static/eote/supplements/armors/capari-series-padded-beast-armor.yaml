name: Capari-Series Padded Beast Armor
description: >-
  Lighter and more flexible than the heavy Destri-series armor, Capari-series padded beast armor by Piccatech Ltd.
  offers an excellent balance between protection and wearability. Similar in construction to TaggeCo.'s Protector X LEO
  armor, Capari armor consists of heavy-duty synthetic textiles woven with energy absorbing foil-fiber armorweave. The
  armor is backed with thin polycarbonate armor plates situated in strategic locations at the animal's neck, shoulders,
  chest, back, and legs. While it offers lighter protection than the heavy Destri-series, the Capari-series is easier to
  wear than its heavier cousin and does not limit a creature's speed or range of motion.

  Padded beast armor can only be equipped to bestial riding animals. In addition to its other effects. using it allows
  the character to ride the beast without suffering the bareback riding penalties discussed on page 81.
