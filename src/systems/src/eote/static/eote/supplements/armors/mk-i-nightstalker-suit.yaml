  Bantin Corp Mk I NightStalker Infiltrator Suit

  The Mk I NightStalker is a lightweight, surprisingly durable suit of armor that Bantin Corp recently produced.
  Marketed toward law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the NightStalker combines light-absorbing materials,
  armorweave, gel-insert plates, and sound dampening fabric to produce a suit that provides both respectable protection
  and decent passive stealth capabilities. The NightStalker is a full-body suit that covers everything but the wearer's
  eyes. It is typically worn with scanner goggles or other wearable vision-enhancement systems.

  When wearing a NightStalker suit, the wearer adds automatic <success></success> to Stealth checks he makes and adds
  automatic <threat></threat> to social skill checks he makes.
