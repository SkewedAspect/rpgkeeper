name: Noble Regalia
description: >-
  Although often inconvenient to wear, severely limiting to movement, and historically archaic, few things command
  innate respect as much as the traditional attire of a planet's nobility. Varying from culture to culture, noble
  regalia typically incorporates multiple layers of ornate, expensive clothing. Although a casual observer might not
  recognize the wearer's exact rank or title, noble regalia nonetheless conveys a degree of aristocratic importance.

  The wearer downgrades the difficulty of social checks to interact with other nobility and their subordinates once.
