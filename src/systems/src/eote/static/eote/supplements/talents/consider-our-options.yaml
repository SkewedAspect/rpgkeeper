name: Consider our Options
description: The character may take the Consider Our Options action, makings **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Negotiation check.** If the check
  succeeds, until the start of the character's next turn, any enemy who attacks the character suffers 2 strain, plus 1
  strain per additional <success></success><success></success> on the character's check, before resolving the attack.
  (If this strain causes an adversary to become incapacitated, the GM may determine that adversary simply bows out of
  the fight.) The effect ends immediately if the character inflicts damage on an enemy.
