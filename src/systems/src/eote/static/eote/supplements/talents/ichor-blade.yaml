id: eote-talent-ichor-blade
name: Ichor Blade
description: When the character purchases this talent, choose one Melee or Brawl weapon they possess that does not
  feature electronic or other high-tech parts. (For example, they could choose a sword or staff, but not a vibroknife or
  electrostaff.) The weapon gains the Cortosis and Pierce 2 item qualities and reduces its critical rating by one to a
  minimum of 1. In addition, any other character adds <setback></setback> to checks they make to use this weapon. If the
  weapon is ever lost or destroyed, the character can apply Ichor Blade to a new weapon. If the weapon leaves the
  character's possession for longer than a single scene or encounter, it loses all effects of this talent until the
  character reacquires it.
