name: Backroom Deal
description: Once per encounter, the character may take the Backroom Deal action, making a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Negotiation check.** If the check
  succeeds the character (or player) reveals how their previously unknown dealings have a meaningful impact on the
  current scene or encounter. The nature of the revelation and its impact on the scene are ultimately subject to the
  GM's discretion, but they should give a significant advantage to the PCs. If the check fails and generates
  <despair></despair>, however, the GM may decide that the character's disastrously failed deal has negative
  repercussions.
