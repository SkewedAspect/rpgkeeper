name: Reflect (Improved)
description: >-
  _Force Talent_. When the character suffers a hit from a a **Ranged (light)**, **Ranged (Heavy)**, or **Gunnery**
  combat check and used the Reflect incidental to reduce the damage from that hit, after the attack is resolved, the
  character may spend <despair></despair> or <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> to automatically hit
  one target within medium range, dealing the same damage as the hit from the initial ranged attack.


  The ranged attack's hit must be one that is able to be reflected and redirected (generally only blaster weapons or
  other energy attacks fall into this category anything else is subject to GM oversight). This talent may not be used if
  the original attack incapacitates the character.
