description: The condition of an item does not affect the price the character receives when selling it. In addition, the
  character can always find a buyer for an item, no matter its condition or how useless or worthless it may seem. The
  details of the transaction are subject to the GM’s discretion, as always, and a buyer might not be immediately (or
  easily) available.
