name: J-10 Dual Blaster Cannon
description: >-
  The Rebel Alliance obtains many of its weapons from battlefield salvage, military surplus, and black market dealers.
  In their search for new locations to establish hidden bases, Alliance scouts also discover abandoned Separatist
  weapons caches, where thousands of pristine, mass-produced weapons await distribution for their cause. Once used by
  the droid armies of the Confederacy, the J-10 dual blaster cannon is now common within outposts of the Rebellion.

  Unfortunately, not all the weapons the Alliance obtains are of high quality. The J-10 dual blaster cannon is a more
  powerful version of the E-5 blaster carbine used by battle droid infantry. Like most Separatist equipment, the J-10
  was produced on unregulated assembly lines run by droids inside factories where quantity was more important than
  quality. The J-10 is finicky at best—glitchy Calven pattern programming often leads to power fluctuations that
  overload the cannon, and imperfections in focusing crystals cause shots to drift without regular maintenance. Alliance
  technicians often  opt to replace the faulty cannons rather than conduct repairs.
