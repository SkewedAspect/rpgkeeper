name: Slugthrower Rifle
description: >-
  A larger version of the slugthrower pistol, the slugthrower rifle also uses chemical reactions to fire a solid
  projectile "slug" at high velocities towards a target. Slugthrower rifles sport much longer and larger barrels than
  pistols, and can fire larger slugs over longer distances. However, they still suffer from poor accuracy and
  penetration, not to mention requiring uncommon ammunition that may either be hand-made and unreliable or prohibitively
  expensive.

  However, many primitive and nomadic cultures use slugthrower rifles, often of some homemade variant. One such example
  are the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine. The primitive and violent nomads have little access to the kind of gas used by
  blasters and even less to XCiter technology. They are able to occasionally capture ammunition in raids on the planet's
  moisture farms, however, and use the rounds in their crude, long-range sniper rifles. These weapons are quite
  effective against the lone settlers, diminutive Jawas, and womp rats that share their harsh desert.
