name: Boonta Blaster
description: >-
  Named after the legendary hero Boonta the Hutt, who allegedly carried a similar weapon, these specialized holdout
  blasters typically appear to be nothing more than ornate and ostentatious pieces of jewelry. Custom-made to the taste
  of individual Hutts, these garish blasters pack enough firepower to ensure that any would-be assassin who gets past
  the wearer's bodyguards does not live long enough to remain a threat. Some of these weapons are treasured family
  heirlooms, passed down from one Hutt to another for many generations.

  Add <setback></setback> to Perception checks to find a Boonta Blaster on a wearer's body. Remove <setback></setback>
  from the wearer's Deception checks to explain away the weapon as purely ornamental or otherwise non-threatening.
