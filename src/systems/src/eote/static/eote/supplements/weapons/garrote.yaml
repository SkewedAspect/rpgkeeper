name: Garrote
description: >-
  The garrote has been the go-to weapon for quiet assassinations for millennia. An extremely simple and deceptively
  lethal weapon, a garrote is a length of cord or cable with a handle often attached at each end. The cable is wrapped
  around a target's throat and the handles are pulled tight at the back of the neck, cutting off air and either knocking
  out or suffocating the target. Garrotes are easy to conceal and can even be made in the field with readily available
  materials.

  A character who makes a successful Brawl attack when using a garrote against a target can cause that target to become
  suffocated. Targets may attempt to break free of a garrote with an **opposed Brawl vs. Brawl check**, adding
  <setback></setback> for each round they have been caught.
