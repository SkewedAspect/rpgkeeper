name: Quad Laser Cannon
description: Quad lasers are dedicated anti-starfighter-weapons consisting of four small-caliber laser cannons linked to
  a single firing mechanism and slaved to a sophisticated fire-control system. They fire four laser blasts with every
  pull of the trigger, and can quite easily fill the space around a ship with enough kilojoules of energy to destroy
  even the toughest starfighter or patrol boat.
