name: E-5 Blaster Rifle
description: >-
  The E-5 blaster rifle is a copy of a BlasTech design produced by Baktoid Armor Workshop for the Separatist armed
  forces. The standard-issue longarm of B1 battle droids, the E-5 is a squat, heavy, short-barreled weapon more like a
  carbine than a full-sized rifle. Despite its size, this weapon packs an incredible punch due to an oversized gas
  chamber and optimized galven pattern. Since the E-5 was built for use by droids, the safety features found on most
  blaster weapons were deleted from its design. Due to this, the E-5 is fragile and runs extremely hot. It is also
  relatively inaccurate due to substandard materials used in its construction. None of these issues are of particular
  worry to the CIS's battle droids. but they make the weapon unattractive to organic customers. 

  If an E-5 suffers damage, it suffers one additional step of damage (see **Table 5-4: Repairing Gear in Chapter V: Gear
  and Equipment** in any of the core rulebooks). Game Masters may spend <despair></despair> or <threat></threat>
  <threat></threat> <threat></threat> generated on a combat check with an E-5 to cause the weapon to overheat. This
  damages the weapon and deals 2 wounds to the wielder if they are organic.
