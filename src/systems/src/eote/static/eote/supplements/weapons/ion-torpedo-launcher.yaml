name: Ion Torpedo Launcher
description: >-
  The rarely seen ion torpedo fills a specialized niche that a great many ship commanders and engineers overlook.
  Lacking the destructive potential of proton torpedoes while inflicting more substantial physical damage than other ion
  weapons, the ion torpedo might provide the perfect solution for a captain who wishes to end a battle quickly but still
  take the enemy vessel (mostly) intact.

  An ion torpedo is designed to release a powerful energy pulse only after puncturing a ship's hull. Consequently,
  powerful deflector shields or thick armor can greatly mitigate the weapon's effectiveness. Still, a well-placed ion
  torpedo can hamstring nearly any ship, ensuring that this specialized ordnance sees continued use by the Alliance,
  particularly on sensitive missions to disable or capture experimental Imperial vessels.

  Additional ion torpedoes cost 400 credits for a set of four.
