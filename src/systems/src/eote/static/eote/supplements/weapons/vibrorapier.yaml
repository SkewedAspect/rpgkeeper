name: Vibrorapier
description: A long, slender-bladed vibrosword, a vibrorapier is extremely well-balanced and suited for professional
  artists of the blade. Designed primarily for thrusting, the vibrorapier can penetrate virtually any armor, making it
  an exceptionally deadly blade in the hands of trained sword-wielder. Unlike other vibroblades, which emit an audible
  hum, vibrorapiers are completely silent, making them useful for those who rely on stealth to survive.
