name: Selonian Shard Shooter
description: A peculiar weapon, the Selonian shard shooter is a relatively compact slugthrower that fires razor-sharp
  crystalline ammunition. Instead of a chemical propellant, the shard shooter uses a sophisticated electromagnetic
  propulsion system to accelerate the shards down its barrel at tremendous velocity. The weapon fires in bursts,
  unleashing a storm of lethal shards at its target, capable of penetrating modern armor and the shredding flesh and
  bone beneath. Since this weapon is only produced on Selonia, finding the shard ammunition outside of the Corellian
  System is next to impossible.
