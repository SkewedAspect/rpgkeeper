name: IR-5 "Intimidator" Blaster Pistol
description: For those who operate on the edge of the law, firepower can be a valuable commodity. The Merr-Sonn
  Munitions IR-5 "Intimidator" can provide that in spades. Though slightly less powerful than most comparably-sized
  blaster pistols, the IR-5 has a rate of fire equivalent to that of a repeating blaster, a feature that earned the
  Intimidator its nickname. Restricted throughout the Corellian Sector, the IR-5 can nonetheless be found on the hip of
  many fringers who call Corellia home.
