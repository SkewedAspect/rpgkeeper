  Speizoc Arms Spore Stun Grenade

  An area effect weapon capable of stunning a group of opponents can be a vital tool in a crowd-control situation.
  Similarly, a person who places a high value on sentient life without killing them. When an individual is significantly
  out-numbered, a stun grenade can turn the tide of battle in an ethically acceptable way.

  Speizoc Arms spore stun grenades deploy a cloud of active stun spores when detonated. Harvested from a carnivorous
  plant, these spores are a powerful soporific for most life forms. An environmentally sealed suit provides complete
  protection against the spores, but any unsealed armor is of little use against the spore cloud. The spores act
  extremely quickly when inhaled, but they can also take effect after contact with the target's skin.
