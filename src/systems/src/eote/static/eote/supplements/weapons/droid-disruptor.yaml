name: Droid Disruptor
description: >-
  Verpine weaponsmiths enjoy creating specialized weapons, such as the Verpine droid disruptor. Unlike a typical
  ionization blaster, the droid disruptor fires a targeted stream of coherent ion energy that overloads and burns out
  droid circuitry and processors. As a result, droids deactivated by a droid disruptor are largely irreparable.

  Due to the deadly nature of droid disruptors—at least, to droids—droids tend to view them in the same manner in which
  organics view disruptor weapons. The weapons are also effective against electronic equipment, though the damage caused
  to vehicles and vessels is largely negligible unless specifically targeted at a particular vehicular system at
  point-blank range.

  When used against organic creatures, the droid disruptor is much less effective. Any organic creature struck by a
  droid disruptor does not receive normal damage, but instead simply experiences a brief shock to the system and suffers
  2 strain.
