description: >-
  Considered incredibly niche, obscure weapons with little combat utility, needlers are a rare sight in the galaxy. They
  are compact, small-framed, slug-throwing pistols that utilize a powerful, miniatureized mass driver to fire sharpened
  ferroceramic darts at very high velocities. The first needlers were introduced by Golan Arms during the height of the
  Galactic Republic. Nearly silent in their operation, and remarkably hard to detect when concealed, they were heavily
  marketed to individuals and government operatives who needed a reliable, easily concealed, difficult to trace weapon.
  Along with their silent operation and ease of use, one of these weapons' biggest selling points is their ammunition.
  Darts fired from a needler bypass personal energy shields with ease, and they can be coated in a variety of lethal and
  non-lethal toxins to subdue or kill targets. This has mde them very attractive to bounty hunters, spies and, and
  assassins, who appreciated their versatility and deadly utility.

  The NX-14 is one of Golan Arms' latest forays into needler technology. Its smallest, most compact offering to date,
  this weapon is slightly smaller than a grown human's hand and roughly as thick as a common datapad. It is constructed
  of an inert, light-absorbing fibermesh polycarbonate with shielded internals, making an already difficult to detect
  weapon nearly impossible to find when concealed properly. The weapon's standard ammunition is a solid,
  spin-stabilized, razor-sharp ferroceremic dart that can punch through nearly any personal armor or shield with ease.

  A needler removes all <setback></setback> added by personal deflector shield. Anyone searching an individual carrying
  a concealed needler adds <setback></setback> to her Perception checks to find the weapon.
