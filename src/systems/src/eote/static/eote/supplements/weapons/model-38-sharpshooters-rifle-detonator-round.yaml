name: Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle (Detonator Round)
description: "While the standard penetrator ammunition offered with the Model 38 works well in most situations,
  sometimes a shooter needs a little extra punch to fell his prey. To this end, Czerka offers the Detonator Round for
  use with the Model 38. Instead of the coated penetrator bullet, Detonator Rounds have a metal coated shaped charge
  bullet that explodes on contact with its target. When used with the Model 38, these rounds have the following effect
  on the weapon's stats: Remove the Pierce quality and add the Blast (5) quality and Knockdown quality. Detonator Rounds
  cost 450 credits for a box of rounds, and have a rarity of 7. If the weapon ever runs out of ammo, a new box of rounds
  must be purchased to reload it."
