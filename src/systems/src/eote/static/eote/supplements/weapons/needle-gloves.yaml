name: Needle Gloves
description: >-
  To all appearances, needle gloves look like typical hand coverings. Indeed, they differ so little from actual gloves
  that they offer very little in combat, with a sole exception: by making a specific hand gesture, the wearer can extend
  an ultra-thin needle that is otherwise practically undetectable.

  Needle Gloves may be loaded with 1 dose of neurotoxin, anesthetic, neuroparalytic (see page 188 of the **Age of
  Rebellion** Core Rulebook), or any other poison the GM deems appropriate. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a
  target with the weapon (even if he deals no damage), the target also suffers the effects of being exposed to the
  poison. Add <setback></setback><setback></setback><setback></setback> to a character's Perception checks to determine
  that a set of needle gloves contain a lethal weapon.
