  WESTAR-35 Pistol

  The latest in the long-running WESTAR line, the WESTAR-35 is the standard-issue sidearm of Mandalorian law enforcement
  and military officers. It is a sleek, medium-frame blaster pistol encased in a sealed, low maintenance polycarbonate
  shell. It fires either blue or yellow blaster bolts (depending on the blaster gas source) is proof against water and
  hostile environments, and has the fit and finish expected from Mandalorian weapons. Like the GALAAR-15, the WESTAR-35
  - in fact, all weapons from the GALAAR, WESTAR, and SHUKUR lines - was never intended for export. That said, many have
  found their way off Mandalore and into the hands of black marketeers. Thanks to its high-quality construction and
  Mandalorian cachet, this pistol demands a premium wherever it is sold.
