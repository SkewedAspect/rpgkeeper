  SakTek D-29 Repulsor Rifle

  Manufactured by the Sakiyan corporation SakTek, this unusual personal weapon uses a repulsor generator to blast its
  target with a wave of concussive force. Employing essentially the same technology as a tractor beam, the D-29 fires an
  invisible ray of electromagnetic energy that violently pushes a target away, knocking down, disorienting, and stunning
  creatures without directly causing any serious lasting damage.
