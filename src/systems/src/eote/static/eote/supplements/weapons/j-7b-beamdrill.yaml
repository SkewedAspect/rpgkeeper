name: J-7b Beamdrill
description: The standard beamdrill used by Corellia Mining Corporation, the J-7b has been in service since before the
  Clone Wars. Using intense pulses of plasma to strip away rock, the beamdrill can carve through virtually anything,
  including armor. While not intended to be a weapon, the cumbersome beamdrill can be extremely lethal if used as a
  makeshift weapon, and has even seen use by pirates to breach the hulls and bulkheads of their prey vessels.
