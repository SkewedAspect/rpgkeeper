name: Rodian Cryogen Whip
description: >-
  Developed by Rodian hunters as an offensive weapon, the cryogen whip appears to be little more than an offensive whip
  with an outer coating of metal rungs. The cryogen whip's relatively mundane outer appearance belies the fact that
  supercooled cryogen circulates at its core, chilling the outer panels When properly used, the whip generates a
  stunning blast and a loud, earsplitting crack. The whip's coils also conduct the cryogen's frigid temperature, leaving
  targets covered in frostbitten welts and cuts.

  This weapon can be used to make melee attacks against targets at up to short range (the difficulty remains Average
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>)).
