name: Combat Knife
description: >-
  Vicious combatants rely on sharp blades to slice and gash their foes. They're also far easier to conceal than a
  firearm and just as deadly if the user is skilled in its use.

  Knives are seen as the weapons of commoners, thieves, and assassins, so carrying one in plain sight may cause social
  stigma in polite company, or add to a rogue's presence in more wretched hives of scum and villainy.
