  By the last days of the Clone Wars, most war materiel hewed to a handful of standards: blasters locked in drab
  plasteel chassis, formless body armor removing all soldiers' individuality. Tholoth, having prided itself on its
  cosmopolitan aesthetic for centuries, struggled with these developments. Their Defense Forces generally used imported
  materiel. It was more practical and more efficient, but it also carried an air of menace. To the Tholothians, clone
  troopers carried a sense of being eager to fire on any who stepped out of line.

  Tholothian Defense Forces solved this tension with the development of their own weaponry. Weaponsmiths incorporated
  heartwood, a plant native to Tholoth, into unique weapons. These heartwood blasters were as much an aesthetic
  statement as they were deadly. The wooden chassis harkens back to the Tholoth seedpod practice-a reminder of the
  community to which the wielder belongs. Like Tholothian society in general, this sentiment reaches across the division
  of species. Anyone who wields a heartwood blaster can find comfort in remembering their home.

  When wielding a heartwood blaster, a character may suffer strain up to their Force rating as a maneuver. If they do,
  they add an equal number of automatic <advantage></advantage> to the next combat check they make that turn.
