  Loronar CryoBan Rifle

  Tools capable of generating intense cold are critical when dealing with preservation but can also be useful in
  scientific endeavors, firefighting, and even some types of manufacturing. When these same tools are weaponized, they
  become potent, typically non-lethal weapons. This is particularly relevant for designs that are portable, including
  liquid-based and energy-based solutions.

  When fired, the Loronar CryoBan rifle's beam dissipates the free energy of its target, effectively triggering an
  extreme drop in temperature. This makes inorganic substances far more brittle, leaving them more susceptible to damage
  from a physical strike. For living beings, the sudden drop in temperature causes a shock to the system that can be
  enough to incapacitate some targets.

  When used to attack a target wearing armor that removes one or more <setback></setback> due to extreme cold, the
  weapon's Pierce quality counts as 0. Characters who make a melee attack against a target struck by the Loronar CryoBan
  in the current round add <boost></boost><boost></boost> to the check.
