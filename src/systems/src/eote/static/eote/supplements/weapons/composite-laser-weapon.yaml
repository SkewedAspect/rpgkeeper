name: Composite Laser Weapon
description: Quarrie has designed a unique fire-linking system that draws power from all weapon systems-along with the
  shields, engines, and numerous other systems by accident-to create an ersatz energy weapon he calls the composite
  laser weapon, or CLW. Although wildly unstable and prone to knocking half the ship’s systems offline when used, the
  CLW provides the Blade Wing with a weapon equal to light turbolaser in power and armor-piercing capabilities. Using
  the CLW is always a risk, and it was deleted from the B-wing before that ship went into production.
