name: Anti-Armor Micro-Rocket
description: When faced with heavily protected targets, or even light vehicles, warheads with shaped explosive charges
  allow a bounty hunter to make short work of normally impressive defenses. While micro-rockets of any variety are
  insufficent to deal with truly hardened targets such as military walkers or speeder tanks, anti-amor charges are more
  than up to the task of dealing with war droids or combat swoops, let alone an armored soldier or bodyguard.
