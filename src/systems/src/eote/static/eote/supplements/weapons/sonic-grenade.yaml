name: Sonic Grenade
description: >-
  Rare and extremely deadly, sonic grenades use powerful sound generators, rather than explosives or other chemicals, to
  cause damage. Ostensibly anti-materiel ordnance, sonic grenades can shatter the thickest glass, crack ferrocrete,
  crumple light alloys, and otherwise cause tremendous damage to structures and equipment. Against enemy forces, sonic
  grenades cause extreme, debilitating pain at a distance and can inflict permanent damage at the point of impact.

  **Models Include:** Krupx Munitions Groundshaker 7, Imperial Munitions M880 Sonic Grenade.
