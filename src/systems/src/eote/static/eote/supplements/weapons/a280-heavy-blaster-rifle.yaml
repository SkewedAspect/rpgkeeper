  BlasTech A280 Heavy Blaster Rifle
  For nearly a century, the A280 C heavy blaster rifle
  has been one of BlasTech Industries’ top-selling military blasters and one of the galaxy's most ubiquitous
  service rifles. Before the Clone Wars, when various
  Republic systems were responsible for defending
  their own territories, the A280 C was the defacto
  official rifle used by planetary armies and private militias. While slightly bulky, it is praised for its incredible
  accuracy, range, penetrating power, and durability.
  Before the Clone Wars, most soldiers trained on
  the A280 C. It wasn’t until more modular platforms,
  such as the DC-15 blaster rifle, were adopted by the
  Republic that the A280 C’s popularity began to wane.
  As the Empire absorbed or disbanded local defense
  forces, decommissioned A280 C’s found their way to
  the Rebel Alliance, where this weapon quickly became
  a favorite for standard infantry, snipers, and Special
  Forces alike. Today, these weapons are cherished by
  many of their users, who work hard to keep them in
  service even as replacements grow harder to acquire.
