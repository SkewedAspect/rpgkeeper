  Goseia HIC "Mercy" Grenade

  When discovered in a compromising position, an operative might prefer a nonlethal means to disable foes, particularly
  if those foes are left with little beyond a clouded recollection of events. Goseia Heavy Industries Concern "Mercy"
  grenades—more often called nightmare grenades in the criminal underworld—fill this need, emitting a hallucinogenic gas
  that distorts perceptions, provokes intense visual illusions, impairs memory, and creates intense feelings of paranoia
  and dread. Nightmare grenades are generally held to be less reliable than their explosive counterparts because the
  effect of the gas varies wildly, and because species that do not need to breath are unaffected by them.

  A character hit by a "Mercy" grenade must make a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Resilience check**. If he fails the
  check, he later has an incomplete or inaccurate memory of events that transpire during that encounter. Additionally,
  he becomes disoriented for 1 round per <threat></threat> on the check.
