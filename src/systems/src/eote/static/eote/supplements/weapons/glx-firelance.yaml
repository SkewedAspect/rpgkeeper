  Blaster Rifle

  Introduced during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, SoroSuub's GLX Firelance is one of the company's most
  popular models of blaster rifle. The product of a long and extensive spate of market research among professional
  soldiers, the weapon was developed to provide a simple, reliable, high performance blaster with most of the power of a
  sull-sized blaster rifle in a package the weight and size of a carbine. The GLX was an immediate success, especially
  among bounty hunters and mercenaries. It was so popular, in fact that SoroSuub marketed the GLX as "the most effective
  weapon available for freelance law enforcement agents". Orders poured in from all across the galaxy, and  the rifle
  soon became one of SoroSuub's best-selling products.

  The rifle itself is a tradtionally-styled, compact weapon closer in size and weight to a blaster carbine than as a
  full-sized blaster rifle. It has a short barrel with an integral flash hide, a top-mounted carrying handle that
  extends the length of the reciever, allowing easier carrying by those with larger hands or in bulky armor, and a solid
  stock with built-in recoil compensators. The GLX features a select-fire system that allows the weapon to operate in
  single-shot or automatic mode, and its stun setting is the most powerful in its class—able to render even the toughest
  opponents or most dangerous creatures insensible.
