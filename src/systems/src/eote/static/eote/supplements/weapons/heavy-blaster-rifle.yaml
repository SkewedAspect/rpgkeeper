name: Heavy Blaster Rifle
description: >-
  Hunters and snipers often carry blaster rifles loaded with particularly powerful accelerant gas, advanced XCiter
  technology, large focusing crystals, or some combination of all three. They're designed to fire extremely powerful
  bolts at large or heavily armored targets and can fire rapid bursts of shots. Heavy blaster rifles are also excellent
  for sniping humanoid targets. The massive damage they cause sends a powerful message to the victim's associates.

  **Models Include**: BlasTech DLT-19, BlasTech RT-97C Heavy Blaster Rifle.
