name: Heavy Tractor Beam
description: Tractor beams are modified shield generators that project a beam of energy that can ensnare starships. Used
  on orbital shipyards, planetary starports, space stations, and many starships, tractor beams are commonly used to
  guide vessels safely into slips and docking bays, as well as to handle cargo. When mounted to warships, they can be
  used offensively to capture enemy vessels and draw them into docking bays for ease of boarding.
