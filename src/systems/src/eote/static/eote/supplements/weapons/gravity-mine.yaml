name: Gravity Mine
description: >-
  Gravity mines are another non-lethal type of mine designed to interfere with a ship's systems rather than destroy it,
  When they detonate, gravity mines release a powerful localized gravitic field bubble out to long range. Gravity mines
  are typically deployed around space stations and other sensitive areas, and are often used along with orbital weapon
  emplacements.

  After the mine detonates, it creates a gravitic bubble out to long range; ships cannot enter hyperspace until they use
  the recuired maneuvers to travel beyond the bubble.
