  Golan Arms Mk VIII Gravitic Mortar Launcher

  Built by Golan Arms, the Mk VIII launcher is an uncommon weapon. Designed primarily to clear minefields, the Mk VIII
  is, like most mortars, a simple smoothbore tube equipped with a bipod and a firing mechanism. Instead of lobbing
  explosive shells into cover or suppressing troops, however, it fires a special round that detonates all anti-personnel
  and anti-vehicle mines in its area of effect. Using advanced gravitic technology, the rounds it fires produce powerful
  gravity fluctuations in a broad area upon impact. These gravity fluctuations trigger mines equipped with pressure or
  proximity sensors, causing them to detonate and clearing the way for troops and vehicles.
   When a gravitic round detonates inside a minefield. it triggers every mine within medium range. Game Masters may use <threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> to detonate only a fraction of the mines within the gravitic shell's area of effect. Undetonated mines remain active and still pose a threat to Player Characters, their allies, and their vehicles.
