name: D-24 Inferno Grenade
description: Restricted to military use or banned entirely on most worlds, the D-24 Inferno Grenade detonates in a fiery
  blast that inflicts terrible wounds and collateral damage. The extreme heat of the blast easily ignites flammable
  materials in the vicinity, causing unpredictable destruction far past the grenade's initial use. An inferno grenade
  causes chaos and panic amongst targets. The indiscriminate and fearsome nature of the weapon ensures only the most
  ruthless mercenaries and killers employ it.
