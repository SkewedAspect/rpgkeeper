name: Lightsaber Pike
description: >-
  Largely considered a ceremonial weapon, long associated with temple guards and Imperial bodyguards. lightsaber pikes
  are nevertheless potent and dangerous weapons in the right hands. Similar in construction to a force pike or
  electrostaff, a lightsaber pike consists of a long, sturdy haft typically made of composites or strong alloys. The
  haft, while a respectable weapon in its own right, contains the internal workings of a standard lightsaber. When
  activated, a shoto-length blade springs from the end of the haft, creating a weapon between two and three meters long.
  Its size gives the lightsaber pike incredible reach and respectable defensive capabilities.

  This lightsaber is a basic lightsaber pike hilt containing an unmodded Ilum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This
  crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points.

  **Models Include:** None: each of these weapons is individually constructed.
