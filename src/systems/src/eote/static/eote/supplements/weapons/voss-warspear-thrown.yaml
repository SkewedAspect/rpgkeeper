  Voss Warspear

  A spear is essentially a blade at the end of a long pole, typically about two meters in length. In a pinch, tying a
  combat knife to the end of a reasonably straight branch is enough to fashion a spear. A less hastily constructed
  version incorporates a double-edged blade as well as a shaft that is made of a material sturdy enough to parry other
  weapons. The city guard of Vossport on Weik prefer heavy, long spears as their primary weapon, as they are simple to
  master and versatile.

  The Voss warspear is a one-handed weapon, however it cannot be wielded with other weapons. It may, at the GM’s
  discretion, be wielded while using a shield.

  A spear may be thrown as a ranged weapon. If used in this manner, change the skill to Ranged (Light) and the range of
  the weapon to short. The weapon also gains the Limited Ammo 1 quality (but if retrieved, it can be used again).
