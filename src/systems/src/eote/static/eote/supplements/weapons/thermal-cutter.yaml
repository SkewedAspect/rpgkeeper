name: Thermal Cutter
description: >-
  Designed for cold-weather expeditions, the Copora-Tech Thermal Cutter is basically a scaled-down mining beamdrill. The
  handheld device projects a heat beam that can evaporate snow and cut through ice, making it invaluable for digging
  snow shelters on inhospitable worlds.

  A thermal cutter’s charge lasts for roughly five minutes of continuous use, and can remove one cubic meter of snow per
  minute, or dig through 10 centimeters of ice per minute. If plugged into a fusion lantern, it can run indefinitely,
  otherwise it requires a new battery. Nefarious individuals can also use a thermal cutter as a weapon with the
  following profile (Melee; Damage 4; Critical 4; Range [Engaged]; Burn 1, Inaccurate 2).
