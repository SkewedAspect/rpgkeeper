  FWG-7 Flechette Carbine

  An example of Malaxan Firepower Incorporated's successful FWG line of flechette weapons the FWG-7 provides all the
  power and versatility of a flechette weapon in a lightweight, easy-to-handle package. A heavier version of the FWG-5
  smart pistol, the FWG-7 is a sturdy, short-barreled carbine built primarily from reinforced polycarbonates and
  advanced alloys. Like its smaller cousin, the FWG-7 fires small-caliber canisters packed with dozens of razor-sharp
  flechettes instead of solid slugs or blaster bolts. Each canister is equipped with a single-use microrepulsor and a
  simple guidance system that allows the canisters to home in on, and even pursue, targets. Once a shot reaches its
  target, the canister explodes and releases a cloud of flechettes that deal a shocking amount of damage to unarmored
  opponents and can even pierce plastoid armor.
