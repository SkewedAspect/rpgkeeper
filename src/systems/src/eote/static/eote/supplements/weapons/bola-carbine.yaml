name: Bola Carbine
description: >-
  Individually handcrafted by weaponsmiths, the bola carbine is a unique and somewhat rare blaster carbine. Natural wood
  is used in the weapon’s construction, specifically in the forearm, stock, and butt assemblies. Though use of wood
  increases the weapon’s weight when compared to modern materials, it allows for a large amount of personalization for
  individual users.

  The most unusual feature of the bola carbine is the charge it fires. The blaster bolt discharged by the weapon is
  combined with a series of hard energy particles that are capable of producing a small energy net that can ensnare
  targets. Though they ensnare targets for a fairly brief amount of time, the hard energy particles often make a
  difference, especially when the user is being pursued by enemies.
