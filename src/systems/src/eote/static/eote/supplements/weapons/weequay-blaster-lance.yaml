name: Weequay Blaster Lance
description: Designed for use in the endless expanse of white sand deserts on Sriluur, these unusual blasters have
  exceptionally long barrels, some nearly two meters in length. While not the most powerful blasters available, the
  particularly long range of these weapons makes them ideal for hunting in the desolate wastes and for desert warfare,
  in which enemies can be spotted at a great distance. Though blaster lances are somewhat cumbersome, many Weequay
  nonetheless carry them for their ability to hit virtually anything visible under the light of Quay.
