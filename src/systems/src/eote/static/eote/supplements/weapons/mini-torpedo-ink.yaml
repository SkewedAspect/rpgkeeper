name: Mini-Torpedo, Ink
description: >-
  These mini-torpedoes contain a reservoir filled with an obscuring black liquid that readily disperses into a large
  cloud upon detonation. Not only does the ink obscure vision and block sight lines, but anyone directly affected by the
  cloud is liable to become disoriented. The ink cloud lasts for up to four rounds, but it can last much longer in
  particularly still water.
