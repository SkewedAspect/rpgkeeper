name: Longeing Whip
description: Used for guiding riderless beasts and driving teams of creatures, a longeing whip is an essential piece of
  a beast rider's kit. Made by companies such as Piccatech Ltd. and Xenovet, longeing whips typically consist of a hide
  or synthetic textile-wrapped composite haft between one and two meters in length. A thin, flexible lash extends from
  the haft another two meters and is used mainly to make noise to recall a wandering or distracted beast to its duty.
  Although mainly a tool, a longeing whip also makes a decent improvised weapon, especially in the hands of an
  experienced user. Its length and flexibility allows a user to keep a threat at a comfortable distance, and the lash
  can be used to distract and even entangle an assailant.
