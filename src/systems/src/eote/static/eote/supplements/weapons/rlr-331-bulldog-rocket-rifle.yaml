name: RLR-331 "Bulldog" Rocket Rifle
description: >-
  Kelvarek Consolidated Arms' RLR-331 is a Clone Wars-era weapon popular with mercenaries and insurgents throughout the
  galaxy. Remarkably similar in appearance to Baktoid Armor Workshop's E-5 blaster rifle-a fact that, during its heyday,
  did not go unnoticed by Baktoid's powerful legal department-the RLR-331 is a bulky weapon wit h a squat, squared-off
  barrel. It launches small guided rockets from a detachable magazine. Originally sold in bulk to the Confederacy of
  Independent Systems, Bulldogs were carried by heavy-support B1 battle droids as anti-materiel and light anti-armor
  weapons. They were used to great effect against the Grand Army of the Republic's heavily armored clone troopers and
  fighting vehicles, and gained a fearsome reputation among the CIS's foes.

  Rockets for the RLR-331 cost 100 credits each and have a rarity of 5.
