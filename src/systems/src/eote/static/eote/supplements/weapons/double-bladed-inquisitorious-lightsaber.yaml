name: Double-bladed Inquisitorious Lightsaber
description: >-
  Inquisitors use a unique double-bladed lightsaber. Its handle incorporates a spinning mechanism that enables the
  blades to rapidly rotate without the wielder needing to take additional action after initiating rotation. The primary
  purpose of this rotation is to improve the blades' ability to deflect incoming attacks. In addition, when used in a
  Saber Throw action, the spinning motion adds stability that adds <boost></boost> to the check and increases the
  blade's damage by +1.

  A character with the Enhance Force power may also use an Inquisitorious lightsaber to fly.
