name: Spore/B Stun Grenade
description: >-
  Produced by Czerka Arms, the Spore/B stun grenade employs stun spores to disable opponents. Because the stun spores
  are airborne, the grenade is completely ineffective against targets wearing breath masks or sealed suits. That said,
  the grenade has proven incredibly effective—and even deadly—when used against unprotected targets.

  Upon detonation, the Spore/B stun grenade releases a dense cloud of stun spores. The spores enter the target’s
  respiratory system and slow the absorption of oxygen into the bloodstream, causing unconsciousness. Despite the claim
  that the Spore/B is a non-lethal weapon, a small percentage of organic beings experience respiratory failure when
  exposed to the spores.

  The first time a character is hit with an attack from this weapon (even if he suffers no damage), he must roll a
  single <challenge></challenge> As long as the character doesn’t roll a <despair></despair> on this, he is affected
  normally by the Spore/B stun grenade. If the roll does result in a the character immediately suffers 6 strain and
  begins to suffocate. A Hard (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Medicine
  check is required to stop the subject from suffocating.

  While the Spore/B isn’t the ideal non-lethal weapon, many spies still continue to use it against the Empire.
