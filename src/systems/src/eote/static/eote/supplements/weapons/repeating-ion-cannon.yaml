name: Repeating Ion Cannon
description: Although the repeating cannon is less powerful than other ion weapons, its high rate of fire can provide a
  great advantage when employed against close formations of starfighters or the point defense systems of capital ships.
  While each pulse carries a lesser charge, the overall energy requirements of a repeating ion cannon rival or exceed
  even the most powerful traditional ion cannons. As a perhaps ironic result, after ignoring an Engineer's warnings, a
  number of captains have found their own ship drifting helplessly alongside the disabled enemy, its systems overloaded
  and drained.
