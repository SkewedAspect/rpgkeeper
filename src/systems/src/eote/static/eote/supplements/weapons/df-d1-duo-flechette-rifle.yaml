  Salus DF-D1 Duo-Flechette Rifle
       
  One of the most notorious weapons in the galaxy, the Salus DF-D1 duo-flechette rifle has earned something of a bad
  reputation due to use by indiscriminate assassins and bounty hunters. Given the weapon’s massive flechette spread and
  the high number grievous injuries it causes (especially in densely populated locales), collateral damage and
  unforeseen fatalities are almost guaranteed. Both local and Imperial law enforcement view the mere act of carrying a
  duo-flechette rifle as a serious crime; they have a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later when confronted
  with one.

  When activated, the DF-D1 fires twin canisters of needlelike flechettes from its stubby dual barrels. The flechettes
  lose speed quickly, ensuring the weapon’s range leaves something to be desired. Despite this shortcoming, the
  flechettes disperse into large clouds capable of affecting several targets at once.

  The DF-D1 is available in both personal and powered armor versions, and it is the primary weapon of the Leviathan
  series of powered armor. Both versions are identical for all intents and purposes, but the powered armor version is
  stripped down and incapable of individual use outside the armor’s systems.
