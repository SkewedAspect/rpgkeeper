name: DDC-MR6 Modular Rifle
description: >-
  A modular rifle that the Drearian Defense Conglomerate designed for the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the
  Clone Wars, the MR6 comes with an electromagnetic rail system that enables the user to reconfigure the weapon quickly
  for different situations. The "rails" (actually electromagnetic strips along the body of the rifle) allow a user to
  quickly swap attachments even in the heat of battle. Due to the high cost of the weapon, the Seperatists never
  purchased more than an experimental manufacturing run before moving on to cheaper alternatives. Nontheless, a few of
  these rare guns remain in circulation, in the hands of collectors or mercenaries who need a versatile weapon that
  fulfills a wide variety of needs.

  A character may make an **Average (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check** to add or
  remove an attachment to a DDC-MR6 as an action rather than spending the usual time required to remove attachment (see
  **Removing Attachments**, on page 93).
