description: >-
  Merr-Sonn's ingenious G-20 Glop Grenade is a reusable, less-than-lethal antipersonnel grenade used to suppress rioters
  and capture fugitives alive. Roughly the size of a thermal detonator, the G-20 is a small metallic sphere covered in
  spray nozzles. As a trigger, glop grenades are equipped with a timer that can be set to detonate on contact or set to
  detonate after a delay of up to fifteen seconds. Inside the sphere is a refillable reservoir that holds a semiliquid
  foam that instantly hardens upon contact with oxygen. When deployed, the user sets his detonation time and simply
  throws it at his target. When it detonates, the grenade sprays its quick-hardening foam over a broad area, trapping
  everything in its range in a thick, nearly unbreakable substance that is almost as strong as ferrocrete. The hardened
  foam is only good for around five minutes, after which it begins to break down and becomes brittle and easy to
  shatter.

  A glop grenade's Ensnare quality triggers automatically on any targets the weapon hits, with no need to spend
  <advantage></advantage>.

  While glop grenades are ostensibly rated as nonlethal, accidents do happen, and they have been known to cause death
  due to suffocation or, in extremely rare cases, allergic reactions to the foam. Whenever a target is hit with a glop
  grenade, he must make an **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Coordination check** to keep the foam from filling his
  breathing passages. Failure on the skill check indicates that the foam has cut off the target's air, and he
  immediately suffers the effects of suffocation as detailed on page 214 of the **Edge of the Empire** Core Rulebook.

  Glop grenades that are recovered after use can be refilled with special pressurized hypoinjectors that transfer the
  foam from a sealed container into the grenade's reservoir without exposing it to the atmosphere. This requires an
  **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Ranged (Light) check** to complete. Failure on the check indicates that the foam
  has been ruined, and any net <threat></threat> gained on a failed skill check means that some mishap with the filling
  system occurs and the user is engulfed in quickly hardening goo. This doesn't require an attack roll, but it does
  require the user to make an **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Coordination check** to avoid getting the goo in his
  nose or mouth per the rules above. Purchase of a Glop Grenade includes the hypoinjector and five refill canisters.
  Additional refill canisters can be purchased for 100 credits apiece and have a rarity of 6.
