name: AP-M1 Armor Piercing Grenade
description: Merr-Sonn's AP-M1 armor piercing grenade is designed to give the common foot soldier light anti-armor
  capabilities in the field. Roughly the size of a clone's fist, the AP-M1 consists of a small shaped charge core
  encased in a plasteel casing. When it detonates, the grenade produces a highly focused blast that can crack open even
  the toughest armor. The AP-M1 can be thrown like a standard grenade or placed and held in position by an integral
  chemical adhesive system. This makes them well suited for precision demolition work as well as anti-vehicle and armor
  use.
