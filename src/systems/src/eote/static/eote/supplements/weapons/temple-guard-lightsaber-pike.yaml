name: Temple Guard Lightsaber Pike
description: >-
  The Jedi Temple Guard were the elite defenders of the Jedi Temple in the days of old, tasked with maintaining order
  and protecting those who resided within. Traditionally, these guardians wielded special double-bladed lightsabers with
  a long handle and could fight with one or both ends ignited. Though few of the weapons of these legendary protectors
  survived the fall of the Jedi temple, rumors say that some of these weapons might have survived the destruction of
  their wielders. The force might well lead one still believes in the ideals of the Jedi Temple Guard to one of their
  ancient symbols of dedication and honor.

  For the purposes of gameplay, this weapon is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed
  lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Illum crystal (see page 197 of the Force and Destiny core rulebook). This
  crystal occupies two of the weapon's hardpoints.

  When purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This
  represents the fact that the double-bladed saber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end).
  However, when installing and modding these attachments, follow all normal rules.

  A Temple Guard Lightsaber pike requires two hands to wield.
