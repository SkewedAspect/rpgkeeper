name: E-22 Blaster Rifle
description: >-
  An uncommon weapon in the Imperial arsenal, BlasTech's E-22 blaster rifle is a medium squad support weapon fielded by
  numerous Imperial special forces units. Used primarily by amphibious shoretroopers, the E-22 is a heavy,
  environmentally sealed blaster rifle designed to stand up to hard use in hostile environments. Larger and heavier than
  the standard E-11 blaster rifle, it features reciprocating double barrels with a more aggressive galven pattern, and
  numerous other features installed to improve performance and survivability.

  The weapon's environmental sealing prevents damage from water, sand, salt, caustic gases, and other dangerous
  environmental hazards.
