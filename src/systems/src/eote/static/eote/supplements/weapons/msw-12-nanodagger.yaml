  Xana Exotic Arms MSW-12 NanoDagger

  Another MSW-series mono-molecular blade offering by Xana Exotic Arms, the MSW-12 NanoDagger is a larger, deadlier
  version of the MSW-9 Molecular Stiletto. Resembling a common combat or ability blade, the NanoDagger's blade is made
  of a synthetic crystaline matrix embedded with super dense alloys that resist wear, chipping, blunting, and breakage.
  It has a mono-molecular edge that can slice through some of the toughest materials, and it can cause vicious, slow
  heating wounds on most being in the galaxy. Despite its reinforcement, like all mono-molecular blades produced by
  Xana, the NanoDagger's blade has an alarming tendancy to break under certain conditions.

  etc.) as described on page 166 of the **Force and Destiny** Core Rulebook.
