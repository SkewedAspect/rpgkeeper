  Blastech DLS-12 Heavy Blaster Carbine

  The DLS-12 is a specialized version of the larger DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle. While it possesses many of the same
  features at the DLT-19, the DLS-12's barrel has been shortened to reduce its bulk. Obviously, the shorter barrel
  results in reduced range, but given that it is designed for close assault, this is not considered a major drawback.

  Designed during the last few months of the Clone Wars, the DLS-12 saw limited use by Republic forces. Republic (and,
  later Imperial) troops tended to eschew it in favor of heavy blaster rifles, though some specialized units prefer its
  shorter range and lighter weight. As a result, surplus heavy blaster carbines have found their way into arsenals
  across the galaxy.
