description: >-
  Redirection crystals are an invention of the Imperial Security Bureau. Produced in small numbers by the Imperial
  Department of Military Research for the ISB and various Imperial intelligence and wetworks teams, a redirection
  crystal is simply a container of pressurized Tibanna gas fitted with a focusing crystal and a short blaster barrel.
  When struck, typically by blaster or slugthrower fire, the canister ruptures and produces a blaster bolt through the
  attached barrel. The bolt the redirection crystal fires has a power output equal to a standard blaster rifle, but its
  range is significantly reduced. A redirection crystal is destroyed on use, leaving little behind to identify what it
  was. Redirection crystals are very popular among Imperial Intelligence agents, who often use them to obfuscate
  assassination scenes or frame others for crimes.

  Setting up a redirection crystal requires a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Skulduggery check**. Due to its size,
  hitting a redirection crystal requires a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Ranged (Light)** or **Ranged (Heavy)
  check**. Redirection crystals have the following profile: (Damage 9; Critical 4; Range (Short); Limited Ammo 1). They
  cost 500 credits (R) and have a rarity of 9.
