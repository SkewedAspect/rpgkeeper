description: >-
  The Palandrix Personal Protection Gear company has been a leading provider of personal armor, defensive weapons, and
  crowd-control devices to the Core Worlds for generations. Known primarily for its broad range of nonlethal weapons
  such as stun batons, sonic stunners, and stun gauntlets, the company also produce a small line of offensive weapons,
  including the handsome and deadly PowerCane. Among its various product lines are a few devices that don't fall neatly
  into any one category, possessing both defensive and offensive attributes that make them extremely versatile and
  effective. One such item is the A014 "Aranea" Net Gun.

  Heavy and squat, the Aranea is roughly the size of a small blaster carbine with a wide-gauge, rifled barrel, and
  lightweight polycarbonate furniture. Officially classified as a grenade launcher, the A014 is a single-shot,
  break-action, breach-loading weapon that fires entangling munitions as opposed to slugs or blaster bolts. The 40mm
  spin-stabilized ammunition used by the Aranea contains a tightly packed, weighted, finemesh net constructed from
  synthetic ArachSilk made by CorChemCo. Upon firing, the shells fired by this weapon burst open at a preset range and
  release the net, the spin of the round causing the net to unfurl and the weights spreading it to its maximum width.
  With its incredibly strong tensile strength and the ability to tighten around an opponent as he struggles, the
  Aranea's nets make excellent tools for capturing animal and sentient targets alive.
