description: Another non-lethal offering from Merr-Sonn, the Tangle Gun 7 is the latest word in crowd control weaponry.
  The Tangle Gun 7 is a carbine-sized rifle with a short, wide-mouthed barrel and polycarbonate furniture that is light
  and easy to handle. The weapon fires a small pellet of naorstrachem, a sticky and extremely flexible
  atmosphere-reactive synthetic memory material. Encased in a shell that falls away once the pellet is fired, the pellet
  explosively expands into a broad, fast moving net upon contact with atmosphere. Once the net makes contact with a
  target, the being's body heat causes the net to quickly contract, immobilizing him completely. Once entangled, the
  target must be cut from the webbing. While the Tangle Gun 7 is advertised as non-lethal, occasionally the net tightens
  so quickly and with such force that it causes lasting harm.
