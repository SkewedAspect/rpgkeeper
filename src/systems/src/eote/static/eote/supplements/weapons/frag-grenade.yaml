name: Frag Grenade
description: >-
  A great variety of grenades can be found throughout the galaxy, from hand-made explosives created with organic shells
  on primitive worlds to mass-produced metallic casings filled with jagged shards of metal. All fulfill the same basic
  purpose—to cause as much damage and mayhem as possible over a large area.

  Frag grenades are very effective against unarmored targets, rending exposed flesh and causing massive concussive
  damage to soft tissues. They are significantly dampened by armor, such as that worn by Imperial stormtroopers. Those
  who wonder why the Empire's foot soldiers wear armor that cannot stop blaster fire have likely never seen them emerge
  from the smoke and ruin of a frag grenade unharmed.

  Frag grenades can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated at
  the beginning of the attacker's action. Some also have a "dead man's" or pressure switch that, once pressed, detonates
  immediately upon release.

  **Models Include**: Merr-Sonn C-22.
