description: >-
  The Nightsisters of Dathomir have always been an organization shrouded in secrecy, an organization of
  warrior-assassins dedicated to the dark side. Their shamans have been said to practice magicks strange to the Jedi and
  even the Sith, and their warriors are most famous for wielding weapons that are in equal parts strange and deadly.
  While their order is rumored to have been destroyed at the end of the Clone Wars by those few who ever knew of its
  existence, artifacts of their culture remain.

  Among these is the energy bows, which uses an energized string to launch a deadly bolt of plasma that can penetrate
  all but the thickest armor with pinpoint accuracy. The bow string feeds into a grip that protects the user's hands
  from the crackling plasma, though it is still a treacherous weapon in the hands of an imprecise user. As with a
  lightsaber, a user who lets the Force guide each bolt can be extraordinarily lethal with this bow, landing miraculous
  shots and bringing down with almost unmatched ease.
