name: Mk.10 Concussion Missile
description: >-
  Like their hand-held grenade counterparts, concussion missiles unleash a powerful blast and accompanying shock wave
  strong enough to incapacitate or injure targets outside of the initial blast radius. Numerous varieties of concussion
  missiles are available from different manufacturers, with some advertised as a non-lethal countermeasure, and others
  as anti-armor weapons. The Golan Arms Mk.10 is an anti-personnel weapon.

  If the user activates a concussion missile's Disorient quality, the Disorient quality affects all characters at short
  range from the target (even if they are not damaged by the weapon). If the user activates a concussion missile's
  Concussive quality, the Concussive quality affects all characters engaged with the target (even if they are not
  damaged by the weapon).
