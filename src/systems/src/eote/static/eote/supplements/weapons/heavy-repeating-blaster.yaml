name: Heavy Repeating Blaster
description: >-
  These deadly weapons are designed to destroy light machinery, armored targets, or opponents in light cover. Heavy
  repeating blasters (such as the E-Web blaster favored by Imperial stormtroopers) are truly support weapons. They are
  set up on tripods and powered by portable generators. They require a two-man team, with one soldier serving as the
  gunner and the other handling the generator and power couplings. In military units, the second operator often monitors
  a communications array attached to the generator for selection of targets.

  Heavy repeaters are far too unwieldy to fire effectively without a tripod, unless the bearer has truly remarkable
  strength. Setting up a tripod weapon requires the crew to spend three actions. The cost of the weapon includes a
  tripod such as the one found on page 193.
