name: DH-17 Blaster Carbine
description: |-
  This carbine is the heavier cousin of the widely popular DH-17 blaster pistol used by the Rebellion. The
  DH-17 blaster carbine has seen heavy use by both
  the Imperial Navy and the Rebel Alliance throughout
  the Galactic Civil War, lauded for its durability and versatility. It has become a mainstay with rebel soldiers
  due to its simple design and the wide availability of
  replacement parts on the black market.
  Much like the pistol variation, the DH-17 blaster carbine is powerful enough to penetrate most personal
  armor, but lacks the ability to breach bulkheads and
  starship hulls, making it ideal for shipboard skirmishes.
  Rebel marines often install a spread barrel modification to make it a deck sweeper commonly referred to
  as the DH-17 short carbine. That, combined with the
  DH-17 carbine's auto-fire capabilities, allows troopers
  to blanket an entire starship corridor with blaster fire.
