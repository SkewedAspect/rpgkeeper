  Tenloss IDX-9 Ion Stunner

  An ion stunner disrupts living beings' neural pathways as well as the electronic components of droids and other
  technological devices. This offers an effective and non-lethal solution for security personnel dealing with threats
  from living beings as well as droids. However, because ion stunners can affect electronic sensors, criminals often use
  these weapons to disable security measures. Different governmental agencies take different legal views of these
  devices because of their alternative uses. All ion stunners incorporate distinctive dish on the barrel, required to
  focus the ionic flash on a target.

  The Tenloss IDX-9 intergrates a collpsible focusing dish. This modification enables the sidearm to be worn in a normal
  blaster holster. However, when drawn and its safety disabled, the dish expands, assuming the weapon's characteristic
  profile. The conversation between holstered and active mode is instant, though most weapon jams with the Tenloss model
  are due to difficulties with this specialized focusing dish.
