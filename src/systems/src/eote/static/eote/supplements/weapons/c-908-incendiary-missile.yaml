name: C-908 Incendiary Missile
description: Combining the fury of a flame projector with the range and power of a missile, an incendiary missile is a
  devastating weapon capable of wiping out entire squad's of infantry in a single blast. Some Hired Guns enjoy the
  particularly powerful effect of an incendiary missile on their enemies' morale. Few sights are as demoralizing as that
  of a missile incinerating one's comrades in a single fiery instant.
