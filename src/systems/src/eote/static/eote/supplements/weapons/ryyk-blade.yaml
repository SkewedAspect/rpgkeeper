description: >-
  The traditional melee weapon of the Wookiees, a Ryyk blade is a heavy, single-edged sword useful for clearing away
  both brush and enemies in the thick jungles of Kashyyyk. Though the weapon has changed little over the millennia, many
  Wookiees prefer the weapon of their ancestors to more technologically-advanced vibro-weapons.

  The damage from the Superior quality is included in the profile.
