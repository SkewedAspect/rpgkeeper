name: Energy Buckler
description: >-
  An energy buckler consists of a metallic disc worn on the wielder's wrist. Once active, the disk projects a small,
  circular shield that can be used to block melee attacks. Given the nature of the energy shield, it can also be used a
  s a melee weapon to bash targets with a stunning blow. Though an active energy buckletr projects of a relatively
  nondescript circular energy field, the projecter disks themselves are often decorated to appear as mundane jewelry. An
  energy buckler has steep power requirements and can only be used for a short period of time before it must be
  recharged.

  When the wielder is using an energy buckler, the GM can spend any <despair></despair> the wielder generates on a
  combat check to have the energy buckler run out of power; it ceases to function until the end of the encounter or
  until recharged.
