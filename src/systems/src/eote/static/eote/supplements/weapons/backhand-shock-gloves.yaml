description: >-
  Produced by Corellian Personal Defense and marketed toward bodyguards, security forces, and law enforcement, the
  Backhand series is one of the most powerful types of shock glove on the market. Using an advanced kinetic energy
  reclamation system to power its high-output circuitry, a pair of Backhand shock gloves gives an individual the power
  and versatility of a stun baton in a wearable glove. However, due to their power requirements and the nature of their
  charging system (which uses the movements of their wearer to charge powerful capacitors), these gloves are slow to
  recharge.

  This weapon has the Slow-Firing 1 rule, meaning it can only be used once every other round. This means that while a
  character may still make Brawl attacks when this weapon is "recharging" he does so without any benefits from the
  weapon—he simply makes an unarmed melee attack.
