name: Light Laser Cannon
description: The standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship
  from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship. Preferred over blaster cannons for their damage and
  accuracy, laser cannons can be paired in batteries or mounted separately. Light and medium laser cannons are often
  found on starfighters and freighters. Heavy laser cannons are mounted to capital ships as secondary weapons to deal
  with smaller ships. Lasers are also often mounted to military ground vehicles.
