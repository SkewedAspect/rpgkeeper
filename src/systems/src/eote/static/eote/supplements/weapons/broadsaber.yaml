name: Broadsaber
description: >-
  Through specialized focusing lenses and emitters, this lightsaber hilt produces a blade that is broader and flatter
  than a standard lightsaber's cylindrical blade, lending it a profile closer to that of a traditional metal sword. This
  form provides a larger overall surface for the massless plasma blade, while forgoing the advantages or a truly
  omnidirectional cutting edge. Broadsabers never gained much popularity among the Jedi Order, with many masters
  dismissing the variant as less elegant than other lightsabers. However, broad sabers lend themselves well to the
  techniques of Shii-Cho, grounded as those are in traditional swordplay, and so the variant found some use among
  masters of Form I.

  This weapon's profile represents a broadsaber hilt containing an unmodded Ilum crystal. This crystal occupies two of
  the weapon's hard points.

  When installing a lightsaber crystal into a broadsaber, increase the damage of that lightsaber crystal by 1.
