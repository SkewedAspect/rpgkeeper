  Czerka Arms A95 Stingbeam

  Small, easily-concealed energy weapons, stingbeams are among the smallest blasters available. Tiny enough to fit in
  the palm of the hand, stingbeams work along similar principles to a blaster, but instead of firing a beam of energized
  particles down a barrel, they focus the blast along a needle-like rod that protrudes between the user's fingers.
  Stingbeams can kill at close range, but their blasts quickly lose cohesion over distance.

  Add <setback></setback><setback></setback> to a character's Perception checks to find a stingbeam on a person's body.
