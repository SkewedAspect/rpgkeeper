name: Model 44 Blaster Pistol
description: Representative of blaster pistols across the galaxy, the Model 44 is a reliable pistol that is more than
  adequate for most situations. Merr-Sonn's Model 44 is well-suited to use aboard starships or in technological
  facilities, as it is less likely to damage vital systems than a more powerful blaster rifle, yet strong enough to
  penetrate laminate armor on a direct hit. As such, it is often used as a sidearm by mercenaries, security forces, and
  pirates.
