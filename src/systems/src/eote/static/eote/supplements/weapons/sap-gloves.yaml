  Sap gloves are produced by a number of companies throughout the galaxy. Made in a variety of styles for nearly every
  imaginable species, they are simply a pair of gloves with heavy plates, alloy pellets, sand, or some other dense,
  weighty material sewn into the fingers and back of the hand. Relatively innocuous when worn, sap gloves amplify a
  wearer's punch and act almost like brass knuckles. Sap gloves are popular among law enforcement and intelligence
  services throughout the galaxy, and their use is extremely common in the criminal underworld.
