name: Slugthrower Pistol
description: >-
  Short, compact, and loud, these small weapons are very rare. Those who wield them frequently do so because they have
  some sentimental value, perhaps handed down to them from some distant relative from a low-tech world, or because these
  weapons are all that's easily available on their world.

  **Models Include**: Oriolanis Striker Projectile Pistol.
