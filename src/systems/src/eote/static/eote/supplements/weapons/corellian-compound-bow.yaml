name: Corellian Compound Bow
description: >-
  A massive bow made of composite materials, the compound bow uses a system of cams and cables to lever the arms and
  reduce the draw weight when fully drawn, allowing for longer, more accurate aiming. This is almost a necessity for
  Corellian bows, since their draw weights tend to be in the range of 55 to 85 kilograms. Some Corellians consider
  drawing a bow a true test of a man's strength, and bows with draw weights of less than 50 kilograms are general
  considered children's models. The impressive tension stored in a Corellian compound bow allows the broadhead arrows
  fired from one to deliver a tremendous amount of kinetic force.

  Regular arrows are cheap to replace; if the GM needs to set a price he can charge I credit per arrow. These bows can
  also be used to fire special explosive tipped or stun arrows instead of the normal broad-head arrows. If these arrows
  are used, use the secondary profile given on **Table 3-1**.
