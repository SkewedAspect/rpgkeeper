description: >-
  Designed ages ago by the Stokhli, a non-human nomadic race from the Inner Rim world of Manress, these long-range
  non-lethal weapons are perfect for crowd control and riot suppression. Used primarily by the Stokhli to hunt the
  large, incredibly aggressive megafauna of their homeworld, the Spray Stick is a meter long metal rod with a tightly
  focused spray nozzle at one end and a stun pad equipped butt-stock at the other. Fired from the shoulder like a
  blaster rifle, these weapons shoot a highly concentrated spraynet mist. The mist condenses into a liquid, then into a
  solid web while in flight, enveloping and immobilizing its target. In addition, as the net envelops its target, it
  delivers a powerful electrical charge. Extremely rare and finely made, each Stokhli Spray Stick comes equipped with an
  accurate range finder and a fine aerosol control system that allows the user to more easily hit targets at long range.
  Despite their rarity and steep price, Stokhli Spray Sticks are always in demand.

  When using the stun pad on the butt-stock, the Stokhli Spray Stick can be used as a melee weapon with the following
