name: Battleship Ion Cannon
description: Ion weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets.
  They use ion turbine generators to create masses of negatively charged particles which are fused with plasma and
  released as blasts or pulses. The negatively charged particles interfere with a target's electrical systems, shorting
  circuits, corrupting computers, and forcing system shutdowns in an effort to subdue a target or make it easier to
  destroy via more traditional means. Although designed to do little-to-no physical damage to targets, collateral damage
  such as fried circuits, fused joints, and even fires may occur due to the intense energy surges.
