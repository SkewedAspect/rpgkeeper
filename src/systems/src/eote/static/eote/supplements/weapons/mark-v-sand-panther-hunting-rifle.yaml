name: Mark V "Sand Panther" Hunting Rifle
description: Coveted by big game hunters who can afford the steep price, the Coronet Arms Mark V "Sand Panther" is a
  superb rifle with excellent range, accuracy, and stopping power. Like other Coronet Arms designs, the Mark V is
  precisely tooled, with handcrafted stocks made of golden creshik wood imported from Tralus. The rifle's exceptionally
  long barrel allows the weapon to be accurate, even at extreme ranges. Due to the length and caliber of the barrel, the
  Mark V is somewhat cumbersome and has a considerable recoil when fired, which is somewhat dampened by a pneumatic
  recoil buffer built in to the rifle's firing mechanism.
