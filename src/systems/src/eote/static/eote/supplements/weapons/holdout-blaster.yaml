name: Holdout Blaster
description: >-
  The smallest of blasters are easy to conceal but still pack a powerful punch. What they sacrifice most is range, due
  to their short barrel and lesser charge. Add <setback></setback> to a character's Perception check when attempting to
  find a hold-out pistol on a person's body.

  **Models Include**: Imperial Army Scout Trooper Blaster Pistol, Merr-Sonn 02 Holdout.
