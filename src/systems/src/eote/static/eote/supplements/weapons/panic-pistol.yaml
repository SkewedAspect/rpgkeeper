description: >-
  War is a stressful pastime. Most sentient beings unaccustomed to battle choke up when an enemy charges them with a
  sword. Sometimes there isn't enough room or enough time to line up a shot. Weaponsmiths designed panic pistols-a kind
  of overpowered slugthrower-to solve such problems.

  They provide a quick and definitive answer to anyone getting too close. This is not to say they do so with elegance.
  The weapons malfunction with more regularity than other, more standard slugthrowers. While its power is on par with a
  blaster, a panic pistol still isn't a sustainable alternative to melee weapons. A fighter with a broken weapon doesn't
  have much advantage over anyone.

  While at engaged range, a character wielding a panic pistol does not add the +1 difficulty modifier for ranged attacks
  in melee. However, the GM may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> to damage the weapon.
