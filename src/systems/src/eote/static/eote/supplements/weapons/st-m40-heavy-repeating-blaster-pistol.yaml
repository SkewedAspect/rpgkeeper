name: ST-M40 Heavy Repeating Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  The ST-M40 is a repeating blaster pistol based loosely on Merr-Sonn's best-selling DD6. Somewhere between a heavy
  blaster pistol and a blaster carbine, the ST-M40 is a medium-sized weapon with a short, heavily shrouded barrel and a
  folding shoulder stock. In combat, the ST-M40 features a select-fire setting that allows it to be fired as a
  single-shot, semiautomatic weapon or in full auto. Although its short barrel and auto-fire setting have a deleterious
  effect on the weapon's accuracy, the ST-M40 is wildly popular among special operations teams and vehicle crews for its
  size, durability, and ease of use.

  During combat, GMs may make this weapon run out of ammunition by spending <threat></threat><threat></threat>. This is
  in addition to the standard spending of <despair></despair>.
