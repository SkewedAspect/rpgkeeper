name: Sword Cane
description: >-
  A traditional accessory of aristocracy who occasionally need to instill an important lesson, the sword cane combines
  the merits of a walking stick with accessible protection. Designs can vary wildly, with some users preferring fancy
  and shiny rods, while other wielders opt for more subdued staves. Typically, a simple twist releases the handle from
  the sheath, allowing the wielder to draw the blade in a rapid, smooth motion. Some incorporate a vibroblade as the
  hidden sword, but the majority of models feature an unpowered blade for better concealment. While sword cane lack the
  weight and killing power of a dedicated combat blade, it is a valuable defensive weapon and can still be deadly in
  master duellist's hands.

  Add <setback></setback> to a character's Perception checks to determine that a sword cane is actually a lethal weapon.

  **Models include:** SoroSuub Elegance-4 Cane, Drolan Platted Sword Cane.
