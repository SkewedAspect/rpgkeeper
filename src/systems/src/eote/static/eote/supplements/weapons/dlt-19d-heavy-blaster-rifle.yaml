name: DLT-19D Heavy Blaster Rifle
description: >-
  The DLT-19D is a weapon BlasTech made specifically for the Imperial Navy's death troopers. Starting with the
  tried-and-true standard stormtrooper DLT-19, BlasTech engineers retooled the weapon to meet the exacting standards of
  the elite corps. The DLT-19D features a unique galven pattern with auxiliary barrels that tap into an expanded central
  energy chamber to offer greater power output and rate of fire. It also features an integral optical telescopic sight
  to improve accuracy over long distances. Its power output and rate of fire have been increased. All of these
  improvements make the rifle an excellent choice for the elite forces of the Empire to destroy rebellious enemies.

  The integrated optics counts as a scope and reduces the difficulty of Ranged combat checks at long and extreme range
  once.
