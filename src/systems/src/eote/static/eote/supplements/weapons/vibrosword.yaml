name: Vibrosword
description: >-
  Many galactic civilizations have long taken to improving the simple but effective blade with induced ultra-sonic
  vibrations. The high frequency vibrations of the cutting edge greatly improve the sharpness of the weapon, allowing it
  to carve through most materials with ease.

  There are many variations of vibroblade, but the vibrosword is fairly common amongst those who fancy themselves
  duelists.

  **Models Include**: Merr-Sonn Damask-4 Duelist Sword.
