description: >-
  Bowcasters are associated with the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. They are as distinctive to the Wookiees as gaffi sticks are
  to the Sand People.

  The various quarrels that can be fired from these weapons allow the wielder a great range of options. Standard
  ammunition consists of metallic bolts accelerated by polarizers astride the barrel tip. This increases the power and
  velocity of the round so that the heavy projectile reaches ranges equivalent to conventional blasters.

  The standard quarrel is a micro-explosive capable of blasting through armor, metal, or thick flesh—like that of the
  giant creatures native to Kashyyyk. Other types of quarrels include sonic detonators, flash quarrels that stun and
  blind, or smoke quarrels designed to create cover for advancing Wookiee warriors.

  Every bowcaster is hand-built for its user—hence the exorbitant cost. Most require significant strength to cock, but
  automatic re-cocking mechanisms are one of the most common modifications (Chewbacca's bowcaster has automatic
  re-cocking, as well as a low-light scope).

  The bowcaster presented here fires standard micro-explosive quarrels, and does not have an automatic re-cocking
  mechanism. It requires the user to spend a maneuver cocking the weapon before each shot.
