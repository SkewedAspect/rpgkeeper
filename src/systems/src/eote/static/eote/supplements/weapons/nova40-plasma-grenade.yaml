name: NOVA40 Plasma Grenade
description: A plasma grenade contains a store of blaster gas comparable to the load of a blaster pistol. When primed,
  an XCiter unit converts the gas to a highly energetic state. After three to sixty seconds, as selected by the user,
  the grenade activates the gas with a laser charge, detonating in highly explosive fashion. The resulting explosion is
  very similar in appearance and effect to a blaster bolt, but more powerful than even a heavy blaster and dispersed
  over a much larger area.
