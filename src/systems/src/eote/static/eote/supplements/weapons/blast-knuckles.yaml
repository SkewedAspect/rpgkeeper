name: Blast Knuckles
description: >-
  This unusual weapon consists of a heavy, armored glove incorporating what amounts to a light blaster pistol on the
  back of the wearer's hand. Impact-sensitive plating across the knuckles fires the blaster when the wearer lands a
  punch, delivering a devastating blast. While these weapons are undeniably effective, they are also dangerous for the
  wielder. Despite the fact that the impact-plating supposedly also shields the user, only the very brave or very
  reckless embrace the idea of a blaster impact just scant centimeters from their fingers. Even the toughest fighters
  can only withstand repeated blaster impacts on their knuckles for so long.

  When using blast knuckles, every successful hit inflicts 1 strain on the wielder (in addition to any strain suffered
  due to check results). Blast knuckles cannot deal damage to a target's strain threshold.
