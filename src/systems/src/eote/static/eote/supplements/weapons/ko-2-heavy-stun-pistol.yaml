  Palandrix KO-2 Heavy Stun Pistol

  Known colloquially as a "coma pistol", the Palandrix KO-2 stands head and shoulders above other stun pistols in both
  power and range. Though as large as a typical heavy blaster pistol, the KO-2 is streamlined and lightweight due to the
  use of orbital alloys and high-density plastics in its construction. Given its size, the weapon is an intimidating
  sight in the hands of a trained professional.

  Primarily used by law enforcement organizations requiring an effective, non-lethal alternative to traditional blaster
  weapons, the KO-2 is generally seen only in the Core Worlds. The weapon has only recently seen use in the Outer RIm,
  and is generally harder to find the farther one gets from the galactic center. despire its relative obscurity, the
  KO-2 continues to gain high marks for effectiveness and reliability.
