name: Lightfoil
description: >-
  Lightfoils are small lightsabers with hilts comparable in size to those of shotos. Lightfoils differ from shotos in
  that they feature slimmer, longer blades. While shotos are often used in pairs, lightfoils are designed for use alone,
  having a small grip that accommodates a single hand. The first lightfoils were said to have been creations of the
  early Sith. They likely arose alongside the Makashi form, as the weapons are perfectly suited to dueling. Among the
  Jedi, lightfoils largely fell out of use in favor of shotos by the time of the Clone Wars.

  This weapon's profile represents a basic lightfoil hilt containing an unmodded Ilum crystal. This crystal occupies two
  of the weapon's

  hard points.

  When installing a lightsaber crystal into a lightfoil, reduce the damage of that lightsaber crystal by 1.
