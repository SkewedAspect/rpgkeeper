description: >-
  Anti-vehicle mines are large, heavy explosive devices designed to destroy walkers, speeders, and other landborne
  vehicles. When deployed, they are buried in shallow pits and covered with soil, leaves, duracrete, or other
  camouflaging agents. They feature both an adjustable pressure switch that can be set to detonate at a certain weight
  threshold and a proximity sensor that detects the presence of repulsor fields. When triggered, either by weight or by
  a landspeeder passing over them, their precision-shaped anti-armor charge detonates, damaging the typically soft
  underbellies of armored vehicles. Anti-vehicle mines are usually deployed in groups, depending on their intended use,
  and are used to protect fortifications and encampments as well as to deny vehicle access to battlefields and sensitive
  areas. While quite deadly, anti-vehicle mines present little danger to personnel, as even at their most sensitive
  setting, they require the weight of a vehicle or the presence of a repulsor field to activate.

  **Models Include:** Merr-Sonn AV70, SoroSuub Model 12 Repulsor Mine.
