name: Z6 Riot Baton
description: This extendable cudgel integrates a set of conductor contact vanes that can effectively subdue a target.
  The Z6 model was designed to partially collapse. This enables the wielder to carrier it at the waist with minimal
  inconvenience. When activated, the same power supply triggers an energy field that stabilizes the baton at its full
  ninety-centimeter size. In addition to serving as a shock prod, the energy field is capable of deflecting an attack
  from a plasma weapon, such as a lightsaber.
