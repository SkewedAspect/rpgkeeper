  Field Sports FS19 Compound Bow (Explosive Tipped Arrow)

  Traditional, projectile-throwing bow weapons are a rarity in the galaxy. They are considered even more archaic and
  inefficient than slugthrowers, and are rarely seen outside of museums or the collections of passionate enthusiasts.
  Even the vaunted bowcaster used by Wookiees is an energy weapon, despite its antiquated appearance. There are times,
  however, when the simplicity, portability, and reliablity of a bow—not to mention its near silence of operation and
  broad selection of ammunition types—are exactly what a given situation requires.

  The FS19 by Field Sports is one of the better bows sold throughout the galaxy. Roughly half as long as a grown human
  is tall, the FS19 uses a system of pulleys and cams to increase an archer's leverage and strength, therefore producing
  a more powerful and efficent weapon in a small easy-to-use package. The bow itself is built from plasteel-reinforced
  polycarbonates, which give it incredible strength, and the string is a polyfiber nylamesh weave designed to minimize
  stretch and sag.

  The basic ammunition used with the FS19 is Field Sports' Mk IV "Broadhead" arrow, which consists of a meter-long
  plasteel shaft with a sharp, bladed point at one end and synthetic, spin-stabilizing fletching on the other. These
  arrows are cheap to replace; the GM who wishes to set a price could charge 1 credit per arrow. In addition, Field
  Sports produces a line of other arrows for use with the FS19 that increase the weapon's versatility. **Table 2—1:
  Ranged Weapons**, on page 47, gives the base profile for the standard arrows that come with the weapon as with the
  profiles for the non-standard arrows for the bow.
