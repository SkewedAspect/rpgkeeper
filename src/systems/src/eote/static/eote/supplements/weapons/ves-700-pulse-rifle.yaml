  Corondexx VES-700 Pulse Rifle

  Often used by urban riot police and bounty hunters, the Corondexx VES-700 pulse rifle has also found a place aboard
  many of the light freighters roaming the galaxy. Firing a rapid series of micro-bursts in a wide blast pattern, the
  pulse rifle is particularly effective in closed spaces, such as the corridors of a starship.
