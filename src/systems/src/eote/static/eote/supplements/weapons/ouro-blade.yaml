name: Ouro Blade
description: >-
  Even for the eccentric designs of ancient Thisspias, the Ouro Blade is a strange weapon, with a long curved blade that
  arches out in a half-circle from the wielder's fists. Traditional fighting styles emphasize quick, cross-body slashes,
  and a skilled fighter can inflict dozens of shallow, painful cuts on their opponent in a matter of moments. While
  designed for off-hand use, the Ouro Blade is still effective as a primary weapon.

  Despite its efficiency, changing attitudes on Thisspias sidelined the Oura Blade. Over time, the populace came to
  associate it with the excesses of the Blood Monarch's Royal Guard. Many Thisspiasians shunned traditional weapons,
  seeing them as shameful relics of bygone times. When Imperial governors outlawed the Blood Monarchy, that stance
  changed. Thisspiasian Rebel groups chose weapons like the Ouro Blade as their gear of choice. The fallen Blood
  Monarchy had become a poignant symbol of resistance.

  After making a successful combat check with an Oura Blade, the wielder may spend <advantage></advantage> to inflict an
  automatic hit on the target, doing the attack's base damage, and may do so multiple times.
