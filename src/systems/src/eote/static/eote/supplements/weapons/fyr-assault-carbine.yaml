name: FYR Assault Carbine
description: >-
  This slugthrower offering from a relatively obscure manufacturer is notable for its high rate of fire. While certainly
  an effective weapon, its biggest advantage is perhaps also its greatest downfall, as the automatic weapon's high fire
  rate highlights the problems of ammunition capacity inherent in all slugthrower weapons. In order to make use of the
  weapon during any sort of extended engagement or operation, the user must weigh himself down with large quantities of
  ammunition, and reload often.

  The GM may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> to cause a PC's assault carbine to run out of ammo.
