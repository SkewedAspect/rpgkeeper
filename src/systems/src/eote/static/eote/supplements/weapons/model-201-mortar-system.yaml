description: >-
  The Model 201 mortar is a portable light artillery system used by specialized clone artillery troopers. Built by
  Merr-Sonn, the Model 201 is a smoothbore weapon that uses an electromagnetic mass-driver system to launch
  large-caliber shells over long distances. The shells are fired in an arc instead of a direct line, which makes the 201
  the weapon of choice for striking enemies behind heavy cover. Primarily a support weapon, the GAR usually deploys the
  201 behind the front lines.

  The weapon consists of three parts—the launcher, a heavy bipod, and the ammunition magazine—and is operated by a
  specially trained mortar team. A mortar team consists of three clones: one to carry the weapon, one to carry the
  bipod, and one to carry the ammo. Working together, a mortar team can keep up an incredible rate of fire, and a good
  mortar team can be a trooper squad's best friend in the field.

  The Model 201 can only be used at medium range or further due to the arc of its shells.
