  Tenlos L70 Acid Projector

  A terrifying weapon, the Tenloss L70 Acid Projector fires a stream of xenoboric acid capable of burning through
  virtually any material. The inert component chemicals are contained within two separate reservoirs within the L70,
  only mixing as the weapon is fired at its unfortunate target. For obvious reasons, these gruesome weapons are banned
  in most systems.

  Acid projectors operate similarly to flame projectors, spraying targets in a narrow cone. When triggering the weapon's
  Burn quality, the user may choose to apply it to any one target hit by the attack; this quality may be triggered
  multiple times, affecting a different target each time. The GM can spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> or
  <despair></despair> to apply the weapon's Burn quality to an ally hit by the original attack. Since the burn is
  chemical in nature, the Burn damage cannot be stopped by rolling around on the ground or jumping into water.
