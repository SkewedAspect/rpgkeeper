id: eote-weapon-lightsaber
name: Lightsaber
description: >-
  The weapon of the Jedi is rare in **Edge of the Empire**. The rogues and scoundrels of the galaxy do not travel in the
  same circles as these revered knights. When such an individual is encountered, tainted souls may want to steer clear,
  for their weapons are made of pure energy and can slice through anything—from limbs to blast doors.

  Lightsabers normally require the Lightsaber skill to wield. However, since that skill is not an option for the Player
  Characters in this book, players must use a lightsaber untrained (selecting either Brawn or Agility as the base
  characteristic). This is deliberate, because there are few people in the galaxy who properly know how to fight with a
  lightsaber. However, if the GM feels it is warranted, he can create the Lightsaber skill as a custom skill for his
  players. Lightsabers cannot be sundered.
