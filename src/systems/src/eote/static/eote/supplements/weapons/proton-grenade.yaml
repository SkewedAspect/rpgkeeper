description: >-
  Frequently used for demolitions work and in boarding actions, proton grenades are extremely powerful devices that rely
  on the same technology as the warheads of proton torpedoes, albeit on a much smaller scale. Nevertheless, proton
  grenades are exceeded only by thermal detonators for sheer destructive power in a hand-held package. Proton grenades
  feature a magnetic clamp and directed charge, so that they are better suited to breaching bulkheads or destroying
  facilities than as anti-personnel weapons. The devices are also highly prized in demolitions work because of the
  sympathetic qualities of the blast. Multiple grenades correctly linked together produce a much more powerful blast
  than each grenade separately.

  When setting up an explosive device using proton grenades, the second grenade adds +20 damage, the third adds +30, the
  fourth adds +40, and the fifth adds +50, for a total of 150 damage for five grenades. After the fifth grenade,
  additional grenades do not add additional damage, but do increase the blast range by one range band per additional
  grenade.
