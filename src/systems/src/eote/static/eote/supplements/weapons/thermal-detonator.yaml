name: Thermal Detonator
description: >-
  These insidious devices are the size of frag grenades, but have a thermite-baradium casing surrounding a baradium
  core. On detonation, the resulting fusion reaction creates a particle wave that disintegrates everything in the blast.
  Most authorities ban thermal detonators because of baradium's instability. One detonator can level a building.

  When using a thermal detonator, any <despair></despair> result on the check means the detonator explodes prematurely.
  The wielder takes full damage from the weapon unless he can perform an additional maneuver to try to get clear; in
  this case, he only suffers the Blast damage.

  Thermal detonators can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being
  activated at the beginning of the attacker's action. Some also have a pressure switch that, once pressed, detonates
  immediately upon release. Thermal detonators are so potent that their Blast quality affects everyone within short
  range of the original target.

  **Models Include**: Merr-Sonn Class-A Thermal Detonator.
