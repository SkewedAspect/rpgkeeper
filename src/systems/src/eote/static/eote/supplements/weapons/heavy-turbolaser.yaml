name: Heavy Turbolaser
description: Massive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons
  mounted to starships. Turbolasers can punch clean through an opponent's shields, armor, and hull with a single blast;
  the lightest easily hulling small ships and the heaviest battering down the defenses of the largest cruiser. The
  trade-offs are their heavy power requirements, their slow recharge time, and their difficulty in tracking and hitting
  small, fast targets like starfighters.
