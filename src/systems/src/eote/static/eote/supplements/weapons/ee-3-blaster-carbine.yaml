name: EE-3 Blaster Carbine
description: The rugged and reliable EE-3 blaster carbine is one of BlasTech's most popular nonmilitary weapons.
  Designed primarily for law enforcement and private security forces, the EE-3 is a short, lightweight carbine based on
  an older full-sized BlasTech rifle. It has a short, heavily shrouded barrel and comes equipped with a pistol grip, a
  solid stock, and an optical sight. The EE-3 is also a select-fire weapon and can fire single shots or automatic
  bursts, an oddity for this class of weapon. Due to its standard features, low price, and solid BlasTech construction,
  the EE-3 is extremely popular with bounty hunters and paramilitary groups.
