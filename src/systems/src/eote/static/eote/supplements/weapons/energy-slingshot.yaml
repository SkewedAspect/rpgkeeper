name: Energy Slingshot
description: >-
  Less a weapon than a device for mischievous pranksters, the energy slingshot is a wrist-mounted device. The user
  points her wrist at the target, pulls back the energized “cup” and, when she releases it, the slingshot fires a
  disorienting shock-burst over short distances. The shock-burst is non-lethal but very annoying, meaning that this
  “weapon” is legal on most worlds. Plenty of municipalities even allow minors to purchase it, to the chagrin of law
  enforcement officers who have to put up with being pelted by shock-bursts from rowdy young hooligans.

  Triggering the Disorient quality on this weapon requires <advantage></advantage> instead of
