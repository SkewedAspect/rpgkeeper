  Incendiary Grenade

  Highly restricted and banned on most civilized worlds, incendiary grenades are anti-personnel grenades that cause
  damage with fire and heat rather than with an explosive charge. A typical incendiary grenade is filled with a sticky,
  volatile gel that bursts into flames upon contact with oxygen or when catalyzed by the grenade's small explosive
  charge. When incendiary grenades detonate, the burning gel sticks to enemy troops and structures alike. causing
  terrible wounds and starting fires throughout the blast radius.
