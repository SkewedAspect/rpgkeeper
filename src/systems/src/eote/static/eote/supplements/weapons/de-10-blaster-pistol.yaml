description: >-
  The DE-10 is a stylish and reliable heavy blaster produced by BlasTech subsidiary Antrech Arms, specialists in
  boutique and niche products. Vaunted for its reliability and ease of maintenance, this fine blaster pistol resembles
  nothing so much as a slugthrower revolver. It is constructed of high-quality materials and can stand up to immense
  punishment in the field. Unlike most blaster weapons, the DE-10 fires a distinctive bright-blue bolt, a feature
  designed simply to set it apart from its competition. All DE-10 pistols come standard with a telescopic optical
  sight. 

  The DE-10's telescopic optical site reduces the difficulty of combat checks made at long and extreme range by one. A
  DE-10 in need of minor repairs does not add <setback></setback> to checks. Add <boost></boost> to checks made to
