  Mon Calamari Spear Blaster
       
  Popularly wielded by the Mon Calamari during the Battle of Mon Cala, the spear blaster is a combination melee and
  ranged weapon. Designed to act as a spear with an integrated blaster rifle, the spear blaster is capable of
  functioning equally well both in and out of the water.

  Though this weapon is not typically seen in Rebel arsenals, many former members of the Mon Calamari Guard bring their
  spear blasters with them when they enlist in the Alliance.
