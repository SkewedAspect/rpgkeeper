name: Fuel-Air Bomb
description: >-
  These bombs are simple explosive devices made from cylinders of compressed volatile gas, most commonly used for
  welding, heating buildings, and powering vehicles or generators. They tend to be extremely destructive thanks to the
  potential energy held in gas and the pressure under which the gas is kept. The cylinders often add a cloud of
  dangerous shrapnel to the already-destructive blast. A large-enough blast from one or a series of fuel-air bombs can
  level a building or destroy a starship. The downside is that, thanks to the volatility of the gasses, these devices
  are touchy; a careless bomb maker can easily make a fatal mistake while working with them.

  A fuel-air bomb's Concussive value increases by one for every additional charge. <despair></despair> on a check to set
  up this bomb means it immediately detonates, dealing its total damage to everything in its current blast radius.
