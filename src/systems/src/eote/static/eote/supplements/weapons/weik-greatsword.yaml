name: Weik Greatsword
description: >-
  Regardless of technological advances, a simple metal sword remains an effective and reliable weapon. A sword never
  runs out of power. It is heavy enough and long enough to give a warrior a significant advantage in combat against an
  unarmed opponent or one wielding a more compact weapon. Legends suggest that long before the invention of the
  lightsaber, the earliest Force adepts used swords as their preferred weapons. A greatsword permits a wielder to employ
  a tremendous amount of power and leverage to each swing.

  The greatsword requires two hands to wield.
