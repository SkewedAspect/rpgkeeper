name: Light Flak Cannon
description: The concept behind flak cannons dates back to the earliest days of powered flight, and is among the
  simplest, most effective anti-fightercraft weapon systems in use today. Using a powerful mass driver, a flak cannon
  fires a large-caliber shell packed with thousands of dangerous, tiny objects such as shrapnel, micro-explosive
  pellets, or inert durasteel flechettes. Flak shells burst at a set distance and spread their contents in a dense cloud
  that can tear small, lightly armored airspeeders or starfighters to shreds in an instant.
