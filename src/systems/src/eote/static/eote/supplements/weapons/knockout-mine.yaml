  Brennkeyes Syndicate Knockout Mine

  Another favorite tool for nonlethal personnel control, knockout charges such as Brennkeyes Syndicate safety mines
  allow the user to safely concentrate on other tasks while being assured early warning in the case of unwanted
  guests—at least, those who need to breath. Smaller and more easily concealed than their lethal counterparts, the mines
  are typically placed at head height and triggered via laser tripwire. Upon detonation, a knockout mine releases a
  flash of light and a neuroparalytic that halts organics who inhale it.

  A character hit by a knockout mine must make a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>)  Resilience check**. If he fails, he
  becomes immobilized until the end of the encounter.
