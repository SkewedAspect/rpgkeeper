name: Borstel Neuronic Lash
description: >-
  The neuronic whip has earned a reputation as the preferred weapon of slavers. Borstel's neutronic lash attempts to
  mitigate this negative impression both through its appearance and its overall function. Instead of using a metallic
  cable, the lash projects a flexible energy strand, which is only emitted from the hilt when activated. The
  insubstantial energy projection is incapable of causing physical injury to a target. However, it carries a
  signification electrical charge. This charge is capable of incappacitating most opponents.

  This weapon can be used to make melee attacks against targets at up to short range (the difficulty remains **Average
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>)**).
