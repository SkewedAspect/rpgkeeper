name: Sorosuub "Persuader" Shock Prod
description: >-
  SoroSuub's Persuader, officially known as the Model VIII Animal Shock Prod, uses the technology found in force pikes
  and shock batons to control large, thick-skinned beasts. A little over two meters long, the Persuader is a long,
  narrow rod with a thicker haft at one end and a multi-pronged tip at the other. The haft contains the prod's power
  cell and controls as well as the non-slip handgrips. When activated the Persuader emits a variable electrical charge
  with an intensity that can be adjusted from a light sting that gets a creature's attention to a powerful discharge
  that can knock a fully grown Wookiee unconscious or render a rampaging rancor meek and biddable.

  Persuader Animal Shock Prods require two hands to wield. This weapon has the Slow-Firing 1 rule, representing its
  electrical charge having to recharge. On rounds during which it is recharging, if the character wants to attack with
  it, he can only use it as an improvised weapon (see page 225 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).
