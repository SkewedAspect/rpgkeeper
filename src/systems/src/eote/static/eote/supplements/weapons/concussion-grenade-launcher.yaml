name: Concussion Grenade Launcher
description: >-
  The more common and less powerful of the two types of shipboard ordnance, concussion missiles are found on all manner
  of spacecraft, from tiny starfighters to capital ships. Roughly a meter long, a concussion missile employs special
  warheads, combining a hardened durasteel penetrator that uses kinetic force to pierce through a ship's armor and a
  shaped high-explosive charge that causes damage through both explosive force and concussive shock. Concussion missiles
  are primarily anti-fighter weapons, used to quickly deal crippling damage to starfighters and patrol boats, although
  they perform well against larger targets as well.

  Concussion grenades are primarily a personal scale weapon, although many military ground vehicles mount concussion
  grenade launchers that fire larger anti-infantry or anti-armor versions. Concussion grenade launchers are typically
  relatively short range ballistic weapons, and thus are useless in space combat.

  Additional concussion missiles cost 500 credits each and are Restricted.
