  Atgar SpaceDefense 1.8 FD Anti-Infantry Autoturret

  Atgar SpaceDefense has been a major developer of

  weaponry for some time, but in recent years, its prominence on the battlefield has diminished. Atgar’s most

  notable contribution to military hardware, the 1.4 FD

  P-Tower anti-vehicle laser cannon, was designed to

  defend ground outposts from the advance of enemy

  repulsorcraft, light armor, and mechanized infantry.

  Its incredible range and ability to operate effectively

  in nearly any environment ensured its widespread use

  for years, but the P-Tower’s lackluster onboard targeting computer, inability to penetrate heavier armor,

  and limited protection for its operator saw it replaced

  by more capable models.

  While organizations such as the Rebel Alliance have

  kept the P-Tower in service, Atgar SpaceDefense has

  sought to breathe new life into unsold inventory by reusing some of the parts from the P-Tower in a new antiinfantry
  weapon: the 1.8 FD Anti-Infantry Autoturret.

  Ostensibly a new product, the 1.8 FD recycles a

  great deal of hardware from the P-Tower, but serves a

  very different battlefield function. While it can be used

  to engage light vehicles, its true purpose is suppressing enemy infantry without putting one’s own troops at

  risk. Thanks to its innate ability to be connected to an

  Atgar artillery remote, it lets a small group of defenders effectively engage much larger numbers of foes

  without leaving the safety of cover. Though extremely

  weighty, this emplacement is considerably lighter than

  a P-Tower, allowing squads of infantry to reposition it

  in the field with the help of a light speeder or loader

  droid. However, this comes at the cost of ammunition

  capacity, and so the 1.8 FD can only fire a few salvos

  before depleting its energy reserves.

  While attached to a suitable power source (such as

  a base’s power grid or a similarly-sized generator), this

  weapon loses the Limited Ammo 8 quality. Wiring the

  weapon into a power source requires several minutes

  and an **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check**.
