name: R-88 Supressor Riot Rifle
description: >-
  Produced by the non-lethal weapons division of Merr-Sonn Munitions, the R-88 is one of the most common riot control
  weapons in the galaxy. First released decades before the Clone Wars, the R-88 is similar in design and operation to
  the rare and expensive Stokhli Spray Stick. These long arms resemble bulky blaster rifles with two large cylinders
  slung beneath the barrel. The cylinders are loaded with a highly effective liquid nerve agent called Brix-C Stun
  Fluid, which is synthesized by Merr-Sonn. When fired, the Suppressor shoots a high velocity, concentrated stream of
  Brix-C that quickly aerosolizes as it travels. Effective at short and medium ranges, the stun fluid deals its damage
  either through inhalation or skin contact and causes nausea, impaired vision, difficulty breathing, burning pain, and
  unconsciousness.

  While highly effective against sudden riots or other disturbances, the stun fluid is easily countered by breath masks
  and heavy clothing. This makes it less effective against determined, well organized targets expecting such weapons. At
  the GM's discretion, characters wearing breathing gear or sealed armor may take no damage or suffer no effects from
  the Suppressor.
