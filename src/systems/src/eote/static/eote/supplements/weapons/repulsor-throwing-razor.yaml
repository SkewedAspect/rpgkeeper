name: Repulsor Throwing Razor
description: >-
  A peculiar and deadly weapon originating in the gladiatorial arenas of Rodia, the repulsor throwing razor combines
  ancient and modern technology. This Rheshalva Interstellar Armaments weapon is a serrated, crescent-shaped blade
  designed to be thrown at its target. The weapon incorporates a miniature repulsor engine to extend its range and help
  guide it toward its target. A homing beacon in the weapon allows it to fly back to the user, although throwing razors
  are often purchased in pairs in case something prevents one from returning. While these weapons are most often used by
  Rodian bounty hunters, their flash and effectiveness have not gone unnoticed by other mercenaries and fighters, who
  have acquired throwing razors for their own use.
