name: Cortosis Sword
description: >-
  The making and use of cortosis swords is, perhaps, as old as the making and use of lightsabers. Cortosis swords were
  created to counter the elegant and deadly lightsabers wielded by Jedi and other Force adherents, and hopefully to
  grant their non—Force-using wielders some hope of survival against a determined lightsaber user. Built in a variety of
  styles, and using varying amounts of cortosis ore in their construction, cortosis-bladed swords, in the right hands,
  pose a decided threat to even the most powerful Force user.

  **Models Include:** Bank Tarn Collective Razorblade.
