name: Destro-6 Demolition Charge
description: >-
  These shaped detonite charges are favored for sabotage missions and clandestine raids: situations with hardened
  targets but limited actual fighting. Setting up the charges takes time and precision although a sufficiently confident
  demolitionist can speed matters up by disabling certain safeties. Once in place, charges can be detonated via timer,
  with delays of up to six hours, or by a remote signal. Properly placed charges are capable of incapacitating armored
  vehicles or blasting major breaches in a fortification.

  Setting up one or more Destro-6 charges with the safeties fully engaged requires an **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>)
  Mechanics check** and takes five minutes per charge. Disabling the safeties for a batch of charges halves the time
  required, but increases the difficulty of the check to **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>).** The GM may spend
  <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> on any Mechanics check using charges with
  disabled safety features to cause a premature detonation.

  When a charge detonates, it deals 20 damage with the Breach 1 quality to every character and vehicle within short
  range. Each additional charge used increases the base damage by 5.
