  Vibro-Ax

  Gamorreans, particularly those employed by the notorious Hutts, often carry meter-long axes fitted with vibration
  technology. Most are very heavy and suited only for beings of considerable strength, and usually with a low center of
  gravity (particularly tall or elegant beings have trouble swinging the heavy axes without throwing themselves
  off-balance).

  The damage a vibro-ax causes is tremendous and messy. The impact area suffers massive and deep trauma from the blade
  and the vibration. Because of this, wounds caused by vibro-axes are particularly nasty—hence the high damage and
  Critical Hit chance. A vibro-ax requires two hands to wield.
