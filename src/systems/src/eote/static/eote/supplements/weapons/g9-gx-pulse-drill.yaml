name: G9-GX Pulse Drill
description: >-
  Designed as a handheld complement to the tried-and-true C2-CE beamdrill, the C9-GX uses a variable-strength,
  continuous-beam plasma projector to perform all manner of jobs, from cutting to welding and brazing to incinerating
  waste material and industrial byproducts. 

  The G9-CX can be found in use in many of the excavations located throughout the tunnels of

  Sullust. It consists of a long, bulky rod tipped by a variable-angle plasma cutter and connected by a reinforced cable
  to a control unit. The control unit contains the fuel cell and many of the controls that manage the power of the
  plasma stream. It is typically worn on a broad belt around the waist.
