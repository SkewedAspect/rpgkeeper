name: Imperial Heavy Repeater
description: >-
  A suppression fire and crowd control weapon used by the Imperial Army, the Imperial heavy repeater fires ionized
  bursts of metallic bolts at an incredibly rapid rate. However, the rifle does have an alternate firing mode that
  allows the wielder to disengage the safeties unleashing a volley that catches multiple targets within a minor
  concussive blast. Its effectiveness even prompted Trandoshan mercenaries and other third-party arms manufactureers to
  create custom rifles fashioned after the Imperial heavy repeater for their own purposes.

  As a maneuver, a character wielding an Imperial heavy repeater may prime the weapon to ecpend all of its emmunition in
  a single, devastating burst. The next time the weapon is fired this encounter, it counts as having the Blast 7 and
  Concussive 1 qualities but does not count as having the Auto-fire quality. After being discharged this way, the weapon
  runs out of ammunition (see page 172 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).
