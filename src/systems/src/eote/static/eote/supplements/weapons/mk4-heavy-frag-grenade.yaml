name: Mk.4 Heavy Frag Grenade
description: Sporting a stronger detonite charge and larger surface area than other frag grenades, Golan Arms' heavy
  fragmentation grenade yields a consequently larger and more powerful blast, with a greater quantity of shrapnel
  dispersed over a wider area. Typically, only very large and physically strong individuals carry heavy frag grenades in
  lieu of standard models, as the increased bulk and weight is a not-inconsiderable hindrance for most users.
