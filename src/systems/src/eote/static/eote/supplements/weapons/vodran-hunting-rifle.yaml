name: Vodran Hunting Rifle
description: These rifles, usually crafted by hand in local Vodran workshops, are commonly found in the hands of skilled
  dianoga hunters (or occasionally in the stomachs of dianogas). While not particularly advanced, these weapons are
  powerful enough to kill most predators that roam the swamps of Vodran. Cunning hunters often set up a blind in the
  lower branches of a mangle tree and wait for a dianoga to pop its eyestalk up from the murky waters, then blind the
  creature with a well-aimed shot before moving in to finish it off.
