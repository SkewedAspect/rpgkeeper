name: RS01 "Ripper" Powersword
description: >-
  Powerswords are large, heavy vibroswords equipped with high-output vibrofield generators that allow them to cleave
  through most materials. Many also feature monomolecular edges, serrated blades. or other performance-enhancing
  modifications that improve their balance or killing power. SoroSuub's RS01 Ripper is a massive, two-handed weapon with
  a straight, single-edged blade like a great cavalry saber. Designed more for heavy, chopping blows than for dueling or
  precision work, the RS01 is designed as much for intimidation as it is for fighting. It is commonly associated with
  enforcers and other unsavory characters who may or may not have something to prove, and has therefore gained a
  reputation as a clumsy and brutish weapon.

  A powersword requires two hands to wield.
