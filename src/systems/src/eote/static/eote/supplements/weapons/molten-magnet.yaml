name: Molten Magnet
description: >-
  Magma from Sembla has fascinated researchers for centuries. Among other traits, it exerts enough magnetic attraction
  to stick to metallic surfaces. While this may fascinate a geologist, it's an idle curiosity to the average citizen.

  Vurk Rebel cells seeking to liberate Sembla are not the average citizen. Straining under the Empire's yoke, they've
  been quite keen to weaponize the planet's lava. A handful managed to make a breakthrough, using liberated Imperial
  research.

  The resulting device is much like a grenade. While difficult to make elsewhere, Vurk Rebels have all they need to
  build them on Sembla. First, they use Imperial technology to stabilize and contain the magma. Early attempts cooled
  and congealed too fast, rendering them useless. To work, the devices need a small touch of the Force: Vurk sages
  skilled in alchemical arts imbue the containment unit with the Force to keep the molten rock from cooling.

  A combatant can use the device much the same way as a grenade. On activation, a brief timer starts before the weapon
  activates. Instead of blasting itself apart, however, the magnet then adheres to a single target. When the timer runs
  out, the containment unit begins extruding its molten metal payload . The magma then chews through armor plating,
  scorching any organic tissue it touches.
