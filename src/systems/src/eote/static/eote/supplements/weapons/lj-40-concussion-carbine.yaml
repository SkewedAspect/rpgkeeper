  Arakyd LJ-40 Concussion Carbine

  Like many tools and weapons combat engineers use, the LJ-40 began life as a field-expedient modification of an
  existing weapon. A squad from the 92nd Coruscant Engineers received a shipment of powerful

  and deadly LJ-50 concussion rifles accidentally. The squad's armorer, seeing that with modification the weapons would
  be perfect for breaching walls and scattering enemy troops, cut the rifles down into makeshift carbines. The
  undeniable effectiveness of the carbines impressed the squad's superior officer. Word eventually reached Arakyd
  Industries, which immediately put the LJ-40 into production to sell alongside the already popular LJ-50.

  The production-model LJ-40 has a folding skeleton stock and shortened barrel. Engineers and vehicle crews love the
  weapon for its light weight, ease of use, and destructive potential. As with all carbines, the LJ-40 suffers from a
  lack of range and poor long-range

  accuracy, but since most military engineers engage the enemy at short ranges, this does not diminish the LJ-40's
  effectiveness.

  All <setback></setback> added to a combat check due to the target's cover are removed when using the LJ-40. Additional
  ammunition costs 40 credits for magazine of 3 rounds.
