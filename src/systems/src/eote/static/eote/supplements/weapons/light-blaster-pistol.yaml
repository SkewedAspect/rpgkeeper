name: Light Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  A good compromise between concealment and power, light blasters are favored by those who often need a firearm—but just
  as often need to pretend they don't. Smugglers, spies, and rogues who don't want to advertise their shadier side are
  all likely to carry light blasters. Smaller-framed species tend to favor light blasters as well, simply for their
  weight and convenience relative to their own body mass.

  **Models Include**: Merr-Sonn Model 44 Blaster Pistol, BlasTech DL-18 Blaster Pistol.
