name: Grappler 213 Tactical Tractor Beam
description: A tactical tractor beam is a relatively small and low powered tractor beam system. While not strong enough
  to control an enemy craft's movement while it is able to maneuver, the tactical tractor beam can slow it down, reduce
  its maneuverability and disrupt its attacks. Some pilots find these devices provide an invaluable edge in dogfighting,
  but others believe the distraction they cause is more trouble than benefit.
