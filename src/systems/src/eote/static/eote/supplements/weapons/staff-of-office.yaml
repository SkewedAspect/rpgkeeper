name: Staff of Office
description: >-
  Although worlds vary by custom, a great majority use historical or symbolic regalia and accessories to distinguish
  their diplomats, envoys, and other such luminaries from simple common folk. These items take a wide variety of forms,
  but many cultures often grant such figures a rod of office, walking staff, or a similarly grandiose stick. Because it
  is a symbol of office, such implements rarely set off weapon detectors, and their holders are rarely required them to
  surrender them as they would blasters, vibroknives, and the like. Some foresighted individuals use this to their
  advantage and train using their staff of office as a blunt-force weapon for worst-case scenarios.

  A staff of office requires two hands to wield. A character adds <boost></boost><boost></boost> when attempting to
  convincing others to allow him to retain his staff of office.
