name: T-7 Ion Disruptor
description: >-
  Originally designed as an anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapon, few arms possess the destructive power and invoke as
  much fear as the T-7 ion disruptor. Each round from the T-7 lets loose a burst of ionized plasma with enough energy to
  penetrate starship hulls and shut down airspeeders and starships, sending them into a death spiral. The T-7 makes
  short work of many armored vehicles and mechanized infantry, as it chews through everything in its path.

  Despite its intended role, the T-7 disruptor obtained its notorious reputation from its use on sentient beings. A
  single blast from the T-7 can de-atomize entire groups of lifeforms. During the Siege of Lasan, agents from the
  Imperial Security Bureau equipped with T-7s slaughtered countless Lasat civilians as a show of Imperial might. This
  atrocity led the Imperial Senate to ban the T-7 ion disruptor and its use, and the rifles were recalled and destroyed.
  However,

  copies of the T-7 schematics escaped deletion, and private weapon manufacturers still produce batches found on the
  black market.

  Like other disruptor weapons, T-7 ion disruptors may never benefit from upgrades or attachments that improve their
  range or grant multiple shots.

  Whenever a living target is hit with a T-7 ion disruptor, any Critical Injury results in a “Crippled” effect, unless
  the roll on **Table 6-10: Critical Injury** Result on page 231 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook would result
  in a more grievous injury.

  Whenever a vehicle or starship is hit with a T-7 ion disruptor, any Critical Hit results in a “Component Hit” effect,
  unless the roll on **Table 7-9: Critical Hit** Result on page 258 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook would
  result in a more serious effect.
