name: Drall Flashstick
description: Used almost exclusively by the Drall constabulary, the flashstick is a non-lethal weapon used to subdue
  criminals and other undesirables. A small metal baton, the flashstick emits a brilliant, coruscating flash of light
  when striking a target, which is capable of temporarily blinding and stunning its mark. The flashstick is particularly
  effective against Drall, Defel, Selonians, and Sullustans, whose eyes are sensitive to light; the weapon has virtually
  no effect on species who don't rely on visual senses, such as the blind Miraluka and the troglodytic Cthon.
