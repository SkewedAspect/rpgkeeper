  Ionization Blaster

  These anti-droid weapons work by combining the power pack of a blaster rifle with a typical droid restraining bolt.
  Somewhat contrary to its name, the bolt doesn't disable a droid mechanically, but instead attaches to its housing and
  issues a broadcast command to halt that cannot be refused. The ionization blaster amplifies the command via the
  blasters power pack to a range of about 12 meters in a wide, unfocused arc.

  Organic life forms feel no more than a brief sting, but droids are blasted with the halt command and simultaneously
  overloaded with energy that prevents any shielding that might resist it. Most droids are rendered inert for up to half
  an hour when hit by a successful ionization blast (reflected in the stun damage).

  Ionization blasters work only on droids and cyborgs, and only deal strain damage as per their Stun quality. They have
  no effect on organic beings beyond a brief and painful sting. Models Include: Jawa scavenged ion blaster, Merr-Sonn
  DEMP 2 Ion Carbine.
