  Creel Wood Logging Corporation is a small, privately owned logging concern founded solely for the harvesting the of
  the highly sought-after Greel trees from the third and fourth planets of the PH System. Greels are hardy, ancient
  trees that produce an extremely dense, deep-crimson hardwood. Thanks to the resilience of the trees and the difficulty
  of harvesting them, GWLC developed special tools to aid in logging and processing. Working closely with a number of
  precision industrial toolmakers from the Corporate Sector, GWLC produced a line of saws, heavy equipment, specialized
  heavy-lift speedertrucks, and other assorted logging machinery for their personal use, and eventually they sold them
  to the general public. Marketed mainly to industrial logging concerns, many of these tools are also used in the
  surveying and exploration of newly discovered planets, especially those with dense and thorny flora. One of the more
  common GWLC tools is the Mk. VIII Vibrosaw.

  Loud and extremely challenging to use, the Mk. VIII is a heavy vibrosaw that can cut through the toughest undergrowth
  or fell the tallest trees. They are heavy, awkward brutes that, in the hands of the inexperienced or inattentive, can
  cause more damage to the user than to the surrounding flora. The Mk. VIII consists of a blocky chassis containing the
  saw's controls, two SureGrip handles, a power pack, a drive motor, and a vibrofield generator. The blade mounted to
  the front of the chassis is long and thin, ringed by a rotating, high-speed, diamond-toothed chain whose already
  impressive cutting ability is further augmented by a powerful vibrofield. Although not designed as such, the Mk. VIII
  can be used as a weapon in an emergency, its blade slicing through flesh and bone as easily as root and branch.
  Caution must be used when doing so, however, as even the slightest miscalculation or misstep can result in the user
  receiving gruesome injuries from his own saw.

  If the user generates <despair></despair> when using the Mk. VIII as a weapon, he hits himself with the attack instead
  of his target (even if the attack would normally miss). The Mk. VIII requires two hands to use.
