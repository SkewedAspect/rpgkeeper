name: E5 Blaster Carbine
description: >-
  The E5 by Baktoid Armor Workshop is a carbine version of their venerable E-5 blaster rifle. Lighter and shorter than
  its full-sized cousin, the E5 was released in the beginning months of the Clone Wars and saw wide use among vehicle
  crews and special operatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This weapon was also issued to B1 battle
  droids, and is the weapon with which those droids are most associated. Like its larger cousin the E-5 blaster rifle,
  the E5 carbine was based on an earlier BlasTech design which was reverse-engineered by weaponsmiths at Baktoid Armor
  Workshop for use with their 00M, B1, and BX series droids. It's a relatively reliable blaster that provides
  respectable stopping power in a small, easy-to-handle package. In addition to its lightened frame and shortened
  barrel, the E5 also features a foldable stock that further increases its usability. As they were largely designed for
  use by droids, vehicle crews, and rear-echelon troops, E5 carbines suffer from a few noticeable drawbacks. They are
  relatively inaccurate over long distances, and thanks to cost-cutting during development, many of their systems are
  built of substandard materials, making them comparatively fragile and prone to overheating during heavy use. While not
  particularly liked or well-respected weapons, E5 carbines are cheap and readily available, having been built by the
  hundreds of thousands during the Clone Wars. This makes them very attractive to more cash-strapped members of the
  Rebel Alliance.

  During combat, the Game Master can spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> to
  force an E5 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the
  **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).
