name: Z-6 Rotary Blaster Cannon
description: >-
  The Galactic Republic purchased many of its heavy weapons from Merr-Sonn Munitions during the last war, but the Z-6
  rotary cannon was by far the most commonplace Merr-Sonn weapon on the battlefield. Due to its widespread use in the
  Clone Wars, the Z-6 is easily found on the black market and through weapons dealers. Rebel heavy weapon specialists
  frequently adopt the Z-6 as their weapon of choice, and Merr-Sonn still manufactures a steady supply for the Imperial
  millitary. With a single pull of the trigger, the Z-6 rotary blaster cannon releases a burst of a dozen shots,
  covering an area in a hail of blaster fire. However, the weapon is prone to overheating, especially when used
  overzealously to provide covering fire or otherwise suppress enemy forces for long periods of time.

  The weapon can only be used in Auto-fire mode. The GM may spend <despair></despair> or
  <threat></threat><threat></threat> from any combat check made with this weapon to have it overheat; the wielder
  suffers 2 strain and the weapon becomes damaged one step; from undamaged to Minor, Minor to Moderate, or Moderate to
  Major (see page 172 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).
