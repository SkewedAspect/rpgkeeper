description: >-
  Dirty fighters and those looking to protect their fists from the tough hides of certain alien species rely on metallic
  knuckles, gauntlets, or other hand or limb coverings. Hoodlums on some worlds refer to them as "negotiation
  enhancers."

  Another great advantage of brass knuckles is their ability to be concealed in a pocket or other compartment until
  they're needed. Add one <setback></setback> die to a characters Perception check when attempting to find brass
  knuckles on a person's body.
