name: Electromagnetic Harpoon
description: Mounted in a remote-operated turret aft of the cockpit, the T-47's electromagnetic harpoon was designed
  with towing in mind. Controlled by the speeder's systems operator, or by the pilot in a pinch, the harpoon consists of
  a pneumatic cannon that launches a short durasteel rod connected to a few dozen yards of high-tensile braided cable.
  The rod is tipped with a powerful electromagnetic disc that receives its power through the harpoon's cable, which is
  in turn connected to a powerful winch located in the hull beneath the cannon. While not a weapon per se, the harpoon
  can be used to knock down personnel or droids, move obstacles, ensnare large creatures or vehicles, and generally
  create havoc, hence its Knockdown and Ensnare qualities.
