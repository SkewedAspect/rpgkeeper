name: Flex-5 Detonite Tape
description: >-
  Created and sold by Merr-Sonn, Flex-5 is an easy-to-use demolitions device designed to destroy small or lightly
  armored objects. It consists of a bulky roil of thick adhesive tape three centimeters wide and fifty meters long wound
  around a polycarbonate reel. The tape is, essentially, highly processed detonite that will stick to nearly any surface
  thanks to its built-in adhesive. Like detonite compound, Flex-5 tape requires an electrical charge to detonate and can
  be set off either remotely or by a timer. Alliance Engineers often use Flex-5 to breach doors and destroy equipment
  such as computer banks or civilian airspeeders.

  A single charge of Flex-5 is a strip roughly a meter long. Since it is extremely simple to use—any trooper who has
  ever fixed a picture to a barracks wall or to the inside of a footlocker can use the tape—the difficulty of using
  Flex-5 does not increase past **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>)** with additional charges.
