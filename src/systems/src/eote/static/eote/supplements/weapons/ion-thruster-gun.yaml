name: Ion Thruster Gun
description: Ion thrusters are used in many different engines, from those of airspeeders to the drives of grand
  starships. Most Technicians have at least one or two of these devices sitting around their workspaces at any given
  time and a hanger is liable to contain many thrusters. As many Technicians can tell you, however, the biggest
  difference between a powerful engine and a gun is where they happen to be pointed. A retrofitted ion thruster's actual
  capacity for damage is low due to the diffuse nature of the blast, but it knock objects over, and the ion signature
  disrupts droids and electronics.
