name: Guard Shoto Hilt
description: >-
  Similar to the shoto lightsaber, the guard shoto or lightsaber tonfa, is a lightsaber with its grip set perpendicular
  to the blade, allowing the wielder to rapidly switch betweek attack and defense, deflecting bolts and blows one moment
  and lashing out with circular attacks of blinding speed the next. While these versatile weapons are extremely
  difficult to master, they can be startlingly effective, especially when paired with cortosis gauntlets to protect
  against slips of the blade.

  The lightsaber is a guard shoto hilt containing an unmodded Illum lightsaber crystal (see page 197 of the Force and
  Destiny core rulebook). This crystal occupies two of the weapons hardpoints.

  When installing a lightsaber crystal into a guard shoto, decrease the damage of that lightsaber crystal by 1.
