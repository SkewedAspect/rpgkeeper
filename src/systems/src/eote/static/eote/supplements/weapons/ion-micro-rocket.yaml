description: >-
  Bounties on droids are not common, but they are frequently profitable, as any droid considered irreplaceable enough to
  mark in such a fashion is often extremely valuable. As such, some bounty hunters invest in ion pulse warheads for
  their micro-rockets, which can disable droids without permanent damage. The power of an ion rocket can can even create
  a power surge in unshielded non-sentient equipment that burns out capacitors or damages circuits.

  The Sunder quality of an ion micro-rocket can only be activated to damage powered equipment, such as sensors,
  blasters, or vibro-blades. It cannot be used to damage items that operate without power, as they have no circuitry to
  disrupt.
