  BlasTech DH-17c Short Carbine

  Blurring the line between blaster pistol and blaster carbine, the DH-17c short carbine is a relatively new addition to
  the venerable DH-17 product line. A shortened version of the DH-17 blaster rifle, it features a snub-nosed barrel cast
  in the same silvery color as the weapon's receiver. Its primary selling point, aside from the small size, is its
  various fire modes. Along with the standard semi-automatic and non-lethal Stun settings, this carbine has an automatic
  setting, giving shooters an extra and unexpected edge in combat.

  While these carbines are not sold with any accessories from the factory, they are often customized with optics and
  folding stocks to increase their performance and usability. A number of Alliance Army engineering units have adopted
  the short carbine as their official-issue weapon, as its size and versatility gives the Engineers the ability to
  switch between working and fighting more easily than with heavier weapons.
