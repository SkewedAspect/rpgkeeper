name: G2 Concussion Grenade
description: >-
  Concussion grenades are powerful hand-held bombs that release a debilitating shock wave over the surrounding area. The
  detonation of a concussion grenade is strong enough to maim or even kill an unarmored target, while the shock wave
  released can incapacitate any foes within the grenade's blast radius. Some concussion grenades are designed to simply
  kill, while others focus on incapacitation. The G2 is an example of the latter, designed to disorient any foes it does
  not eliminate.

  If the user activates a concussion grenade's Disorient quality, the Disorient quality affects all characters at short
  range from the target (even if they are not damaged by the weapon).
