name: Jammer Missile
description: This countermeasure follows but does not attempt to impact the target vehicle. Instead, it fires a jamming
  beam at the vehicle (see Jamming Beam, below) If the initial combat check is successful, the missile follows the
  target at close range for one round per <success></success>. The missile adds <setback></setback><setback></setback>
  to the target's **Gunnery, Piloting, and Computers checks** (when the pilot is scanning with sensors). The missile's
  limited fuel means it self-destructs after 3 rounds. The missile can be shot down, but it has a silhouette of 1. Any
  damage destroys it.
