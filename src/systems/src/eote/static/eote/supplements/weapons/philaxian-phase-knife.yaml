name: Philaxian Phase-Knife
description: >-
  Developed originally by an obscure cadre of artificers, these blades were popular amongst cutpurses and assassins
  before Republic scouts discovered Philaxia. Once the population obtained technology such as vibroblades and other
  modern conveniences phase-knives fell out of favour. The weapons may have remained an unremarked oddity had a
  wandering Jedi not stumbled across one decades later.

  Philaxian phase-knives appear as no more than knife-hilts in their inactive state. When activated, however, they
  project a molecular shield that forms a weightless but solid "blade". The blade is sharper than comparable vibroblade,
  but its unique balance makes it very difficult to wield. The user can also adjust the size and shape of the blade on
  the fly; certain shapes make it surprisingly good as a thrown weapon.

  When used with the Saber Throw talent, a character may spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> or
  <triumph></triumph> (instead of <forcepoint></forcepoint>) to have the phase-knife return to her hand. A user may not
  add lightsaber crystal attachments to a phase-knife. Anyone searching a character carrying a deactivated phase-knife
  adds <setback></setback> to the Perception check ti find the weapon.
