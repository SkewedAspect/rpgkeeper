name: DH-X Heavy Blaster Rifle
description: The DH-X from BlasTech is a powerful weapon favored by mercenary soldiers with an appreciation for heavy
  weaponry. Amongst the largest heavy blaster rifles manufactured by BlasTech, the DH-X can drop most targets with a
  single shot. However, the power increase means a slower rate of fire. As such, the DH-X fills an important niche
  between blaster rifles and repeating blasters.
