name: Explorer's Knife
description: >-
  Nearly as ubiquitous as combat knives, explorer's knives are indespensable tools for professional foresters. Made by a
  variety of weapon and tool manufacturers, explorer;s knives typically have a long, serrated, clip-point blade mounted
  in a sturdy, reinforced plasteel hilt and are sold with a synthetic nylamesh sheath. Contained within the knife's
  seath and hollow, watertight handle are the contents of a miniature emergency survival kit. While the contents vary by
  manufacturer, they typically include a fire starter, tweezers, small sharp blade, magnetic compass, fishing hooks and
  line, monowire saw, needle and thread, length of high-tensile synthetic cord, small whetstone, and other bits of small
  survival gear. While an explorer's knife is not neceassarily as well stocked as a full survival kit, it does work very
  well as an emergency backup or as a supplement to a more fully stocked kit – and, of course, it is a potent weapon to
  boot.
