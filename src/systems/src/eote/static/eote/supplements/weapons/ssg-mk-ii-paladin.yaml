description: >-
  Contracted by the Republice specifically for use by the Senate Guard, the Mk II Paladin is an ornate, highly accurate
  blaster rifle designed for ceremonial use. Built to exacting specifications by SoroSuub, Paladin rifles are as much
  works of art as they are weapons. With their highly polished black barrels and frames, pearlescent silver
  polycarbonate furniture, and ornate fittings, they are striking weapons that make quite an impression on those who see
  them.

  Despite their officially ceremonial nature, these weapons are incredibly potent in combat. Respectable range and
  accuracy, and the ability to switch between single-shot, and auto-fire make Paladin rifles very dangerous in the right
  hands. From the factory, they are fitted with slings, collapsible stocks, and a number of other features designed to
  optimize their combat efficientcy while maintaining their ceremonial look. In addition, when  assigned to Senate
  Guardsmen, these weapons were fitted with an under barrel stun prod that combined with their stun setting, made them
  suitable for crowd control duties as well as combat.

  Today, Paladin rifles are a rare sight and most remain in storage armories deep below the Imperial Palace on
  Coruscant. Some have made their way to the galactic weapons market, however, commanding steep prices whenever they are
  sold.

  The damage from the Superior quality is included in the weapon's profile. When the integral stun prod is used in clos
  combat, it has the following profile: Melee Damage +2; Critical 6; Range (Engaged); Disorient 2; Stun Damage.
