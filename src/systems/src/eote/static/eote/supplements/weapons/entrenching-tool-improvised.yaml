name: Entrenching Tool (Improvised)
description: >-
  In appearance and function, this useful tool is little more than a small shovel or spade, though common military
  versions feature a collapsible or foldable shaft for compact storage. Soldiers across the galaxy use this ubiquitous
  device to dig latrines, foxholes, and other makeshift entrenchments, and occasionally to neutralize alien fauna.
  Though the design seems simple, the edge of an entrenching tool is razor-sharp and made from hardened durasteel,
  making it a dangerous weapon.

  Besides allowing the user to dig holes and entrenchments, the Imperial Army Entrenching Tool counts as a small
  improvised weapon that deals +2 damage instead of + 1, has a Crit Rating of 4, and does not break due to
  <despair></despair> or <threat></threat>.
