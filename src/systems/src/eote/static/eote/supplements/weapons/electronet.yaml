name: Electronet
description: Electronets were once preferred by the Republic Scout Service when capturing newly discovered animals on
  alien worlds. They have since become popular with bounty hunters and law enforcers the galaxy over. Constructed of
  duracord with interwoven stun threads or beads, electrones can be manually draped over targets to ensnare them They
  are also capable of being loaded into net guns for ranged applications, or used as ground traps by canny hunters.
  Traditional activation of an electronet is accomplished with a handheld transmitter to avoid unintenionally stunning
  the user. Alternatively, a user might wear insulated glives to protect against the nets incapacitating charge.
