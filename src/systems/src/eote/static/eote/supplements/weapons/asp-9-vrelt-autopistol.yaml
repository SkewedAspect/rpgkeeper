name: ASP-9 "Vrelt" Autopistol
description: Marketed by Talus Ironworks as the ASP-9, this pistol is more commonly known as the Vrelt, after a vicious
  rodent native to the Corellian System. A cheap, simple design, the ASP-9 fires comparatively small rounds in rapid
  bursts. Though notoriously inaccurate, the weapon's ability to unleash a hail of lead and the ease with which it can
  be concealed make the Vrelt a favorite of thugs and criminals. It is not uncommon for bodies riddled with slugs to be
  found in the back alleys of the Blue Sector or the slums of Dearic.
