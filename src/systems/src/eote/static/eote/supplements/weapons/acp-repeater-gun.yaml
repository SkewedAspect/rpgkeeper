  Arakyd Industries ACP Repeater Gun

  The Accelerated Charged Particle repeater gun is a medium range blaster carbine capable of laying down a tremendous
  field of fire. Designed prior to the Clone Wars for use in urban and close combat firefights, the weapon was deemed
  underpowered for general use and saw limited assignment to commandos and other specialized units. However, the ACP
  repeater gun has enjoyed success in the private market, particularly among criminals, who appreciate the weapon's
  ability to spray a small area with bolts of deadly charged particles. So popular is the ACP repeater gun among
  Trandoshan mercenaries and Gank killers that it is often referred to as the "Trandoshan Chopper" or "Nar Shaddaa
  Grinder."
