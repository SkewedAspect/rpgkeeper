name: Contained Energy Axe
description: >-
  Until activated, a contained energy axe is easily mistaken for a common vibro-axe. However, rather than relying on
  ultrasonic vibrations for its cutting power, a contained energy axe houses a diatium power generator that, when
  activated, produces a magnetically contained energy blade along the edge of the axe head. While the hefty axe relies
  on raw strength to inflict much of its damage, the addition of a centimeter of coherent plasma along its cutting edge
  allows the weapon to slice through nearly any material with ease.

  A contained energy axe can use appropriate Melee weapon

  attachments, but not lightsaber attachments.
