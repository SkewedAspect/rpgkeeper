name: Poison Gas Grenade
description: >-
  While most would balk at using poison gas in combat, some bounty hunters and assassins use it to inspire terror in
  their targets. Droid bounty hunters and Gand findsmen, who are unaffected by airborne toxins, often employ poison gas
  grenades. They can be filled with deadly gases, such as dioxis, trion, or Fex-M3.

  Poison gas grenades can be loaded with up to 1 dose of neurotoxin, anesthetic, or neuroparalytic (see page 172 of the
  **Edge of the Empire** Core Rulebook) or other poison (such as those on page 109) that the GM deems suitable. Whenever
  the wielder successfully attacks a target with the weapon (whether or not he deals damage), the target also suffers
  the effects of being exposed to the poison.

  Unless used outdoors in a windy environment, the poison gas lingers for 2 rounds, affecting anyone caught in the
  cloud. If used in a closed, poorly ventilated space, such as a small room or narrow starship corridor, the gas lingers
  for 5 rounds instead. Poison gas grenades do not harm droids and other creatures that do not breathe air. Characters
  equipped with vacuum sealed suits, breath masks, respirators, or rebreathers are also unaffected by the poison gas.
