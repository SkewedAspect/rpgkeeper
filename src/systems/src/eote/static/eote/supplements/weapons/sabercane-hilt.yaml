description: >-
  Sabercanes are a bit of an anomaly among the Jedi.  Essentially a basic lightsaber emitter built into a walking cane,
  they are typically used by elderly Jedi or by individuals who need to carry a lightsaber but keep it hidden. Most
  sabercanes consist of two parts: the hilt/handle and the shaft. The handle is a lightsaber hilt disguised as a cane
  handle. They come in a wide variety of styles and are as easy to use, modify, and maintain as basic lightsabers.
  Sabercane handles connect to their matching shafts via a simple bayonet fitting or custom quick-release mount. 

  A sabercane's shaft is made from the same material as its handle and is typically solid-although they can be made
  hollow for carrying small, secret items. A wielder simply separates the two parts and activates the lightsaber to use
  it. The shaft may be used as an offhand weapon. Some sabercane shafts are even reinforced with Cortosis weave or
  beskar and can turn lightsaber blades as easily as lesser weapons. 

  This weapon is a sabercane hilt equipped with an unmodded llum crystal. The crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard
  points. 

  When installing a crystal into a lightsaber cane, reduce the damage of that crystal by one. 

  Provided here are the hilts for the lightsabers listed in this chapter. Each requires a crystal to become a true
  weapon (otherwise they deal no damage, have no critical rating, and do not have many of their item qualities).
  However, a PC wanting to construct their own lightsabers should start with a hilt. If the PC wants to construct his
  own hilt out of available materials, the GM can still have him make a check to find the hilt, based on its rarity, and
  pay the cost. This represents the PC finding and paying for the raw materials. Then it is simply a matter of spending
  a few hours putting the materials together to build the hilt—no checks are necessary.
