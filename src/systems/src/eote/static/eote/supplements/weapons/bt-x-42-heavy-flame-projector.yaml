name: BT X-42 Heavy Flame Projector
description: >-
  The BT X-42 heavy flame projector, from BlasTech, is one of the most destructive and terrifying weapons in the GAR's
  arsenal. Carried by specially trained clone Flame troopers, this weapon is used primarily against massed, unarmored
  opponents in an anti-personnel role. It is also well suited to clearing rooms and bunkers, denying areas, and
  destroying enemy materiel.

  Like most flame projectors, the X-42 can he as dangerous to friends as to enemies and has a nasty reputation for
  overheating or even exploding when damaged

  Game Masters can spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> to cause the weapon to overheat, leaving it
  inoperable for three turns, or <despair></despair> to have the weapon explode. An exploding X-42 deals full damage to
  the user and Blast damage to anything engaged with them.
