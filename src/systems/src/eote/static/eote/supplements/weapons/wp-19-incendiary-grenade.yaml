  Merr-Sonn WP-19 Incendiary Grenade

  Incendiary grenades are relatively uncommon among the galaxy's militaries. Most civilized planets, especially in the
  Core, banned their use long ago as inhumane, and they often persecute users for war crimes. There are still many
  places where their sale and use are legal, however, and both the Imperial and Alliance militaries use them.
  Merr-Sonn's WP-19 is one of the more common incendiary grenades on the market. Filled with a volatile mixture of
  jellied incendiary compounds, accelerants, and adhesives, the WP-19 burns white-hot on detonation and spreads sticky,
  burning incendiary gel over a wide area. Imperial combat engineers are notorious for using these grenades to destroy
  enemy buildings and materiel, often with enemies and civilians alike trapped inside.
