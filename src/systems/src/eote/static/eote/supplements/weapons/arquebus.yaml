  The average sentient being can pick out visual details up to three kilometers away. Sembla's low landmasses and
  shallow seas provide excellent visibility. Taken together, these factors had a large influence on Vurk strategy. They
  favor long distance engagements, avoiding melee whenever possible. The lone soldier who wades into close range is
  liable to get gunned down without mercy.

  Since heavy industry never took hold on Sembla, Vurk sharpshooters still favor slugthrowers. Most famous is the
  arquebus, an older design kept current by skilled crafters. In its original form, the weapon was little more than a
  metal tube filled with explosive powder. Over time, sumptuous wooden stocks to brace against the shoulder became
  standard. The design became more streamlined and reliable as time went on. Modern versions are works of art unto
  themselves, often featuring intricate obsidian inlays.

  Accurate at extreme distances, the weapon is well suited to patient aiming. A Vurk soldier's most devastating shots
  are the ones arranged with the most precision. Skeptics have long since explained this away in mundane ways. Longer
  prep time leads to steadier hands. Calculations of wind resistance are more accurate with more observation. Despite
  this, Vurk sages insist on a deeper meaning. The best sharpshooters never care about the odds. They trust in the will
  of the Force, and the Force guides their hands.

  As a maneuver, a character wielding an arquebus may suffer up to 5 strain. The PC's next combat check with the
  arquebus gains Pierce with a rating equal to the strain suffered.
