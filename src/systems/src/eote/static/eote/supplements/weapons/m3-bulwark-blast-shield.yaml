name: M3 Bulwark Blast Shield
description: Typically carried by riot or military police, or security in particularly rowdy ports, blast shields are as
  much a weapon as a protective device. Roughly as tall as a full-grown clone, the M3 Bulwark is a curved sheet of
  reinforced plasteel that can be strapped to one arm. A small, narrow viewport is sot in the top of the shield, which
  allows the user to see while using it. Thanks to its shape and the inherent strength of plasteel, the Bulwark can
  shrug off most small-arms and light blaster rifle fire, as well as shrapnel and splinters from grenades and other
  explosive devices.
