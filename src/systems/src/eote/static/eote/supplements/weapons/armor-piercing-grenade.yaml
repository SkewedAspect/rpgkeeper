  Armor-Piercing Grenade

  Armor-piercing grenades, commonly known as AP grenades, are offensive grenades designed to give an individual trooper
  respectable anti-armor capabilities. Used as both anti-armor and anti-materiel weapons, most AP grenades use precisely
  calibrated shaped charges housed in specially designed casings to focus all of their explosive force on one small
  area. This allows them to be deployed against armored vehicles or structures with little collateral damage to the
  surrounding area. Despite their tightly focused area of effect, AP grenades still have a decent blast area. One or two
  tossed into a squad of Imperial stormtroopers or other soldiers in heavy armor can cause more damage than a whole
  handful of frag grenades.

  Many AP grenades, especially those designed specifically for anti-armor and anti-materiel work, are equipped with
  either a magnetic or chemical adhesive system that allows them to be placed on walls, floors, and vehicle hulls for
  pinpoint demolitions and targeted sabotage.

  Like frag grenades, AP grenades can be set to detonate on impact, set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after
  being activated, or use a pressure detonator.
