  Merr-Sonn N-4 Noise Grenade

  When confronted with a hostile situation, a quick escape is sometimes the wisest course of action. Other times,
  fatally wounding individuals might cause a diplomatic disaster or have other repercussions. In such situations,
  nonlethal grenades are the best recourse, providing a relatively cheap area-of-effect alternative to a stun shot. When
  deployed, Merr-Sonn N-4 noise grenades and other similar weapons release a horrendous burst of sound across the
  spectrum, causing temporary but incredibly intense pain in most sentient species. The cacophony typically lasts for
  only a few seconds, but the lingering effects give the user a chance to escape or seize the initiative.
