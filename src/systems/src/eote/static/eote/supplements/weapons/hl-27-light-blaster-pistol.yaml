name: HL-27 Light Blaster Pistol
description: The HL-27 is a sterling example of the superior craftsmanship of weapons produced by Coronet Arms. Favored
  by the well-heeled of Corellia and those who wish to carry a first-rate blaster without necessarily announcing that
  they are armed, the HL-27 is an excellent choice for those who prefer discretion to bellicose valor without
  sacrificing firepower. It is not uncommon for CorSec agents who can afford them to carry the HL-27 in preference to
  the standard CDEF blaster pistol.
