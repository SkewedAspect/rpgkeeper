name: Bardottan Electrolance
description: >-
  Bardottans traditionally wield a one-handed lance as a ceremonial weapon. Lances hold a cultural significance to the
  species, as Bardottans have used them as their preferred melee weapon since long before the incorporation of modern
  technologies. Modern electrolances are similar to force pikes in that they emit a powerful blast when striking the
  target. They can also be set to stun. This setting is most commonly implemented when used by law enforcement personnel
  seeking to incapacitate a suspect for further questioning.

  The grip of the Bardottan electrolance is placed in the middle of the weapon. The lance is carried like a walking
  stick, with the longer end extended above the wielder’s head. It is the longer end that is used to strike a foe. In
  combat, the shorter end is typically pivoted to parry incoming attacks. The shorter end also incorporates a
  counterweight, making it better balanced for one-handed use.

  The Bardottan electrolance is a one-handed weapon, however it cannot be wielded with other weapons. It may, at the
  GM’s discretion, be wielded while using a shield.
