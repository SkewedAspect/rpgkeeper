  Tenloss Spray Foam Grenade

  Tenloss's spray foam grenades are ten-centimeter plastic spheres sealed with a low-powered energy field and equipped
  with a timer activator. When the timer finishes counting down, the field deactivates, exposing the chemical reagents
  within it to each other. This triggers a sudden chemical reaction. The liquid inside expands, forming a foam polymer.
  This can expand to fill a volume of up to three cubic meters, entombing anything that happens to be within that space.
  The polymer is unstable, however, and it begins to break down after only a few minutes of atmospheric exposure. Until
  that breakdown completes, it is quite rigid, presenting an effective means to temporarily incapacitate an opponent.

  A spray foam grenade's Ensnare quality triggers automatically on any target the weapon hits, with no need to spend
