name: Lightning 22 Ion Grenade
description: The detonation of an ion grenade is much like the blast of an ion gun. The advantage of an ion grenade is
  that all droids caught in the blast radius are affected, allowing the user to disable multiple mechanical targets at
  once. Great care must be taken in the vicinity of important technology. Many starship captains refuse to allow ion
  grenades aboard their vessel, even when providing transport to heavily armed mercenaries.
