name: Force Pike
description: >-
  Force pikes are one-meter long metallic staves topped with power-tips. One setting on the power-tip vibrates
  powerfully enough to shatter flesh, steel, and stone. The other setting provides an electric shock that can be set
  relatively low to prod or control, or high to cause excruciating pain or death. Either setting is designed for ease of
  use—it takes little skill to swing a stick and cause devastating injury with the vibro or electricity setting. In the
  hands of a skilled user, however, it's almost as powerful as a lightsaber.

  When used with its Stun Setting, a Force Pike does not benefit from the Pierce 2 Quality. Force pikes require two
  hands to wield.
