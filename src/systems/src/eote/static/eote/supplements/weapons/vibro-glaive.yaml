  Beastmaster's Vibro-Glaive

  Most often found in the hands of the Weequay, these vibro-glaives consist of a heavy, single-edged head affixed to a
  pole up to two meters in length. Such weapons are particularly popular among the dark wolf beastmasters of Sriluur,
  who use the flat edge of the polearm to keep their charges in line, exploiting the glaive's reach to maintain a
  relatively safe distance from the lethal tails of the raquor'daan. The Weequay made use of vibro-glaives in their wars
  with the Houk, using these vicious weapons to even the odds in close combat.

  The beastmaster's vibro-glaive requires two hands to wield.
