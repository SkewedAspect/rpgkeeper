name: Parrying Vibroblade
description: The parrying vibroblade is a high-tech version of the parrying dagger. Pairing a high-frequency vibroblade
  with the wide crossguard or basket hilt of a parrying dagger, a parrying vibroblade is a dealy addition to any
  duelist's arsenal. Even against weapons not easily deflected directly, such as lightsabers, an off-hand vibroblade can
  force attackers to consider strikes cautiously, lest they leave themselves vulnerable to counterattacks with the short
  blade.
