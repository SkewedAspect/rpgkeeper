  Spukami Pocket Blaster Pistol

  This unassuming pistol produced by Fed-Dub Protective Services Inc. provides citizens of the double worlds with a
  last-ditch punch for personal protection. The Spukami is designed for close-quarters combat only, and while it hits
  hard, it also loses accuracy quickly at any kind of range.

  When firing the Spukami at short range (or longer), the weapon gains the Inaccurate 1 quality (it does not gain this
  quality when fired at an engaged target). Add <setback></setback> to a character's Perception check when attempting to
  find a holdout pistol on a person's body.
