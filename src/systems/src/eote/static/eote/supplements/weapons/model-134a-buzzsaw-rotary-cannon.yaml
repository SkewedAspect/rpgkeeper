name: Model 134a "Buzzsaw" Rotary Cannon
description: >-
  Loud, heavy, and dangerous, the Model 134a is the heaviest portable slugthrower produced by Czerka. Known colloquially
  as the "Buzzsaw," thanks to the noise it makes when fired, this weapon is a belt-fed, six-barreled rotary cannon that
  fires thousands of rounds per second and can chew up infantry formations and light vehicles with ease. Power and
  ammunition are fed to the weapon via reinforced belts and cables from a backpack that carries the power pack and a
  sizeable load of small-caliber ammunition. Thanks to their weight and prodigious recoil, it takes quite a bit of
  strength and stamina to effectively use these weapons, and they are typically supported by a bipod or sling while
  being fired. In addition to their weight, noise, and recoil, Buzzsaws consume immense amounts of ammunition and have a
  nasty tendency to overheat and jam when fired for extended periods of time.

  The Model 134a can only be fired using the Auto-fire quality. Game Masters may spend <despair></despair> or
  <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> to have the weapon overheat and jam. When a Buzzsaw jams, the user
  must perform a maneuver to clear the jam before it can be fired again.
