name: Disruptor Pistol
description: >-
  Illegal throughout most of the civilized worlds, disruptors focus such a highly energized beam of particles that they
  can disintegrate limbs or other large parts of their victim's bodies. The technology is essentially that of a blaster
  rifle, but with an oversized XCiter and

  a specialized actuating module that processes a much higher volume of blaster gas than usual. This combines with a
  galven cylinder that super-focuses the resultant beam. Most disruptor weapons have a very poor range, although some
  rifle variants have a boosted range through expensive reinforced galven cylinders and are designed specifically for
  snipers and sharpshooters.

  The Tenloss Syndicate manufactures one of the few mass-produced disruptors, the DXR-6 rifle and the DX-2 pistol. Their
  main client is the notorious Black Sun criminal organization, but they also service a smattering of ruthless rogues
  and other scoundrels. A few Imperial inquisitors and interrogators have been known to brandish these weapons as well,
  but perhaps more for the intimidation and terror factor than their practicality.

  Whenever a victim is hit by a disruptor, any Critical Hit results in a °Crippled" effect unless the roll on **Table
  6-10** would result in an even more grievous injury.

  Disruptors may never benefit from upgrades or attachments that improve their range or grant multiple shots.

  **Models Include**: Tenloss DXR-6 Disruptor Rifle, Ten-loss DX-2 Disruptor Pistol.
