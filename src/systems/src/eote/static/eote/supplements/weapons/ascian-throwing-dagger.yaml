name: Ascian Throwing Dagger
description: >-
  Named after the binary star system from where they supposedly originated, Ascian daggers are finely weighted and
  balanced for throwing. Crafted of durasteel and honed to a mono-molecular edge, these blades are deadly in the hands
  of a skilled user.

  When making an attack with an Ascian throwing dagger, a character does not increase the difficulty of the check for
  being engaged with his target as normal. The user adds his Brawn to the listed value (+ 1) to determine the damage
  dealt with this weapon.
