name: DC-17 Hand Blaster
description: >-
  The standard-issue sidearm of the GAR, BlasTech's DC-17 is one of the most rugged and reliable blaster pistols
  produced. Typically issued to vehicle crews, weapon teams, and officers, these heavy blaster pistols pack incredible
  stopping power into a relatively small package. They are lightweight and well balanced, and they have a very
  respectable rate of fire. Recently, ARC troopers and other special forces teams have taken to carrying the DC-17 as a
  backup weapon and for close-quarters combat.
