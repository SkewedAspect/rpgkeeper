name: SSB-1 Static Pistol
description: Originally developed by long defunct Systech Corporation several thousand years ago, the design was
  recently revived by SoroSuub as the SSB-1 static blaster pistol. Firing a powerful bolt of electricity generated by
  high-energy piezoelectric crystals within the weapon, the static blaster is only useful at close ranges, but a couple
  of blasts can bring down a Wookiee or even a full-grown gundark. Due to the exceptionally low energy requirements to
  supercharge the crystals, energy packs in static pistols can power the weapon through thousands of firings. However,
  the internal alignment of the crystals is very exact, and the pistol can stop functioning if damaged or roughly
  handled.
