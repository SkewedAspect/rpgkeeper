name: Mini-Missile Pack
description: The missile bank launcher is a self-contained missile battery that holds eight to ten missiles designed to
  fire as a group or cluster. The bank fires half of its payload at a time. The missiles or rockets are designed to fire
  in a spread pattern. They depend on quantity far more than the accuracy of the individual weapons. The Arakyd Missile
  Pack typically faces a specific firing arc, selected at the time of installation. A turret-mounted variation requires
  an additional hard point. Standard missile banks may be mounted to vehicles of silhouette 2 or greater. Mini-missile
  variants may be mounted to a vehicle of silhouette 2.
