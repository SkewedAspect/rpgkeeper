name: Cortosis Shield
description: >-
  While law enforcement officers and some mercenaries might carry high-tech riot shields for use in crowd control
  situations, the common defensive shield is vanishingly rare on the battlefield. In the modern era of focused energy
  weapons, high-powered slugthrowers, and ship- and vehicle-mounted ordnance that can turn a sentient into a pile of ash
  in a heartbeat, even plastoid armor is of arguable value. In the face of heavy fire, most individuals prefer either to
  present an overwhelming force or to retreat. Those who deal with the remnants of the Jedi Order, such as the
  Inquisitors and the secret police units of the Galactic Empire, often have need of specialized equipment.

  Cortosis shields are made from various alloys or synthetic compounds and are laced with a refined cortosis weave that
  absorbs blaster energy and can even turn or disrupt the blade of a lightsaber. Due to their inherent strength,
  cortosis shields can be used as a makeshift Melee weapon, allowing a user to bash or push away an opponent.

  **Models Include:** Arakyd Industries Special Order Model 3 Shield.
