  X-30 Lancer

  Lightweight and easy to use, SoroSuub's X-30 Lancer is one of the most popular sporting blasters on the market.
  Designed with competition shooters and pistol hunters in mind, the Lancer is optimized for range, accuracy, and
  stopping power. Built to SoroSuub's exacting standards, the Lancer is a sleek, modern-looking blaster pistol with a
  long barrel and a weighted, finely balanced stock. Firing a blaster bolt that is well out of scale for a weapon its
  size, it uses a custom-formulated, highly volatile mix of blaster gasses and a supercharged actuating module to fire
  intense, highly concentrated bolts accurately over long distances. Superior galven patterns in the barrel reduce beam
  degradation and dispersal, allowing the pistol to maintain effectiveness well past the range of other weapons of its
  class.

  In the Outer Rim, Lancer pistols are relatively common, especially among those who need a powerful weapon in a
  lightweight package. Many speeders and atmospheric craft have one of these fine pistols tucked away in an
  easy-to-reach storage locker, and many starships include them in their escape pods and emergency kits as a defensive
  weapon. They are also especially popular among explorers and scholars for their easy handling characteristics, as well
  as by those big-game hunters who enjoy the challenge of pistol hunting.
