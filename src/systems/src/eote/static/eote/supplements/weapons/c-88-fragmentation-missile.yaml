name: C-88 Fragmentation Missile
description: Designed for use against infantry rather than vehicles, a fragmentation missile functions much like a
  typical frag grenade, scattering shards of metal over a wide area, shredding tissue and shattering bone. Frag missiles
  are absolutely deadly to unarmored or lightly armored targets, and pose a considerable threat even to those protected
  by battle armor.
