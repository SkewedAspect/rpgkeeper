name: Dusk Blade
description: The mysterious Nightsisters use a number of bladed weapons, the most common of which is a deadly short
  sword. Carried both in battle and for ceremonial purposes, this weapon has a curved, single-edged blade similar to
  that of a scimitar or cutlass. The blade is broad at the tip and tapers toward the hilt, then flares out again where
  it meets the minimal handguard. It has a short, one-handed hilt and a guard on the outer edge below the cutting edge.
  Lightweight, flexible, and easy to handle, these swords are lethal in the hands of a trained user.
