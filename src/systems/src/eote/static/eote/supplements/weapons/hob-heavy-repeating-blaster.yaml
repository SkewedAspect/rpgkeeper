name: HOB Heavy Repeating Blaster
description: >-
  The High-Output Repeating Blaster from SoroSuub is a powerful and reliable weapon. Rarely seen outside of military
  forces, the HOB typically requires a crew of two to operate as an emplaced weapon, though it is possible for an
  individual of exceptional strength to carry the weapon. Remarkably, despite its high rate of fire and energy draw, the
  HOB's robust, simple construction makes somewhat easier to repair in the field, and it is amazingly easy to set up and
  take down. The cost of this weapon includes a tripod such as that found on page 193 of the **Edge of the Empire** Core
  Rules. Setting up this tripod weapon requires the crew to spend two preparation maneuvers, plus two more for the
  tripod.
