description: >-
  The E-11D is the standard-issue longarm of the death troopers. Designed for the kinds of close-quarters and urban
  combat situations that death troopers excel at, the E-11D is a lightweight, sturdily built blaster carbine that trades
  range and accuracy for sheer stopping power and short-range performance. The E-11D has a large-bore reinforced barrel,
  and comes equipped with integrated features to improve power output, balance, and handling.
