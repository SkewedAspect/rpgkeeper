  Herloss HBt-4 Hunting Blaster

  Larger and heavier than most other sporting blaster rifles, the Herloss HBt-4 hunting blaster packs a very heavy punch
  for a civilian blaster. Designed for hunting big game and the large, aggressive predators of the Outer Rim, the HBt-4
  forgoes the long range of many sporting rifles in favor of a more concentrated blast that disperses relatively
  quickly. The HBt-4 is most commonly found on rough terrain or tropical worlds with heavy vegetation, where its shorter
  range is not a handicap. The hunting blaster has also found a place aboard some light freighters where its ready
  firepower provides an extra sense of security.
