  as speeder bikes, landspeeders and smaller airspeeders. It may carry a variety of missile types (see **Table 2-8:
  Specialized Missiles and Rockets for Vehicles**), which are typically about a half-meter or less in length. The tube
  faces a single firing arc, though a turret mount is also available. It may be installed on any non-starship vehicle of
  silhouette size 2 or greater."
