name: Lucky Blaster
description: >-
  A blaster being "lucky" is less about its manufacture and more about its behavior. There is something inherent in
  these blasters, something beyond the normal. A spacer might feel that, no matter how long the odds, a blaster like
  this will always hit its mark.

  Even in the clumsiest hands, there seems to be an unknown influence guiding the spacer's aim. To the trained Mystic,
  the Force's presence is obvious-the blaster almost hums with it. Even before dedicating themselves to the Force, a
  Mystic might be able to hear it.

  Lucky blasters are rare in the galaxy at large. Their attunement to the Force seems to be completely random. There is
  no connection between the blasters that display this knack. There is no single factory, nor even one single planet,
  that can claim it is the source. Not even the Mystics who study them can explain how the blasters' attunement occurs.
  Those who wield these blasters can only trust in the Force, hoping that its will is being done.

  When a character uses a single maneuver with a Lucky Blaster to Aim, they gain <boost></boost><boost></boost> on their
  next combat check. This can only occur once per round, and the PC may not use their second maneuver to aim again.
