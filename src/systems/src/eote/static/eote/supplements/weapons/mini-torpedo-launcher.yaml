  Mon Cal Defenses Mini-Torpedo Launcher

  The Mon Cal Defenses mini-torpedo launcher is a portable weapon designed exclusively for sub-aquatic combat
  situations. Based on a design that was originally only integrated into suits of heavy armor, the portable version is
  small enough to be considered a squad support weapon.

  Featuring an integrated two-torpedo magazine, the mini-torpedo launcher is capable of using standard anti-personnel
  mini-torpedoes, as well as specialized torpedoes depending on combat requirements. Though unguided, the torpedoes are
  extremely accurate, especially in the hands of a skilled operator.

  The mini-torpedo launcher can only be used effectively underwater. All combat checks to operate it outside of the
  water have their difficulty upgraded twice. The profile provided with this weapon is for the default torpedoes.
  Specialized torpedoes can be loaded into the launcher. While these torpedoes are loaded, they replace the damage,
  critical rating, range, and item qualities of the original weapon with their own. Regardless of what is loaded in the
  launcher, it maintains the Cumbersome quality.
