  Czerka Arms 411 Holdout Blaster

  Developed for use by Imperial agents, the 411 holdout blaster's supercharged actuator module and tight muzzle emitter
  give it impressive range for a holdout blaster. The increased range comes at the cost of overall stopping power when
  compared to other holdout blasters. Though intended for the exclusive use of the Empire, Rebels stole the design
  specifications and a large shipment of 411s, flooding the black market with the small, deadly weapons.
