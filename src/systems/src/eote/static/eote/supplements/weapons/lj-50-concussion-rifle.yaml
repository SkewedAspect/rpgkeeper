name: LJ-50 Concussion Rifle
description: |-
  Developed by Arakyd Industries, the LJ-50 concussion rifle delivers intense concussive bursts over short
  distances, smashing cover and rattling the troops
  within. The blast from a concussion rifle produces
  a shock wave capable of knocking banthas off their
  hooves, or putting entire groups of targets in a daze.
  Imperial soldiers, Alliance heavy weapons specialists,
  and hired guns of all stripes frequently use concussion
  rifles to scatter enemy formations, neutralize entire
  squads, and even punch through duracrete walls.
