  Taggeco. Cryoban Projector

  These devices were originally designed to extinguish fires aboard starships using a supercooling chemical agent, but
  independent operators quickly discovered that removing the safety nozzles from CryoBan projectors could turn them into
  lethal weapons. Many smugglers keep several of these stashed in strategic locations around their ships, both to put
  out fires and, if necessary, repel boarders.

  CryoBan projectors can be used to fight fires. A character armed with a CryoBan projector adds <boost></boost> to
  attempts to put out a fire. Assisted checks to extinguish the flames add one additional <boost></boost> for each
  assist-ing character equipped with a CryoBan projector.
