  Arakyd Industries Caltrop-5 Chaff Gun

  The Caltrop-5 by Arakyd Industries is ostensibly a physical countermeasures system that uses clouds of alloy splinters
  to spoof sensors. When activated, the Caltrop-5 fires a canister that bursts after a set distance, creating a massive,
  glittering cloud of durasteel shrapnel that confounds missile guidance systems and makes vessels using them difficult
  to target. The chaff cloud also makes a frightfully potent anti-ship weapon, as discovered by Jadthu-class pilots
  during the Battle of Haruun Kat when fast-moving vulture droid starfighters were chewed up by clouds of Caltrop-5
  chaff.

  As a physical countermeasures system, the Caltrop-5 upgrades the difficulty of all Gunnery checks and checks triggered
  by the Guided quality made using missiles, rockets, or torpedoes targeting the starship once.

  In addition, it upgrades the difficulty of Piloting checks for other ships within close range once.
  <despair></despair> on a Piloting check may be spent to inflict a Critical Hit on that pilot's ship.
