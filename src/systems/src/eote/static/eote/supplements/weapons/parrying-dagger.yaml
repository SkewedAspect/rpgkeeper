name: Parrying Dagger
description: Typically used in the off hand, the traditional parrying dagger consists of a slim, double-edged blade with
  a wide (sometimes forked) guard or a basket hilt for hand protection. In addition to possessing defensive utility, a
  parrying dagger can be used offensively, often as part of a feint or riposte. Traditional on many worlds where
  advanced technology is rare or melee duels are part of the culture, such blades can be found across the galaxy.
