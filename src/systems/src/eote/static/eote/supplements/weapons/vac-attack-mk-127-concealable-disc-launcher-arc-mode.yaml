  Vac Attack Mk-127 Concealable Disc Launcher

  Initially designed by the Vacutech Combine—which ran out of capital and declared bankruptcy during the development of
  this weapon thanks to Imperial meddling—the Vac Attack is a small projectile launcher worn around the wrist like a
  chrono. It fires bursts of small, extremely sharp discs that can shred armor and flesh like a flechette. The weapon's
  spread can be adjusted so that it fires all of its discs in a single line or in a broad arc that can catch multiple
  targets. Entirely silent and easily concealable, the Mk-127 is often used for jobs in which silence and stealth are
  paramount.

  Changing the weapon's spread from single to arc requires a maneuver and grants the weapon the Blast 6 item quality. If
  Blast is activated, the weapon's supply of discs is exhausted in the shot. When worn on both wrists, Mk-127s can be
  fired as if they were a single weapon with a regular combat check, gaining the Linked 2 quality. Noticing that an
  individual is wearing one or a pair of these weapons requires a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Perception check**. At the Game Master's
  discretion, the discs can be coated with various toxins. Reloads for the Mk-127 contain four discs and cost 100
  credits.
