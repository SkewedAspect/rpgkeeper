  SoroSuub CS-12 Stun Master

  Produced by SoroSuub and popular with many Sullustan members of the Rebel Alliance, the CS-12 stun master is one of
  the most ubiquitous non-lethal weapons in the Alliance’s arsenal. Palm-sized and effective, it is easily concealed and
  is legal to carry in most systems. In addition, the device is constructed from consumer-grade materials and can be
  smuggled past standard weapon detection devices without raising alarms.

  Designed as a small cylinder only fifteen centimeters in length, the stun master has thirteen contact studs that
  emerge from its disk-shaped business end. When these contacts are pressed against an opponent and the device
  activated, a silent electric charge is released that results in unconsciousness or disorientation.

  Add <setback></setback> to a character’s Perception checks to find a stun master on a person’s body.
