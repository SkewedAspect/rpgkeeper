  Liquidsilver L7 Light Blaster Pistol

  A simple, inexpensive blaster pistol, the Liquidsilver L7 has developed a reputation among smugglers as a good weapon
  to have in a pinch. The L7's compact size, clean lines, and steel finish make the blaster fairly inconspicuous and
  easy to overlook, especially if stowed for quick and easy access on the wall of a cargo hold or beside the gangplank
  servos of a light freighter.

  blaster pistol stashed aboard a starship.
