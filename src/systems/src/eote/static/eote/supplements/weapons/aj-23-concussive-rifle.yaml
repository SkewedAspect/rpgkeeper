  Merr-Sonn AJ-23 Concussive Rifle

  Crowd-control situations pose a significant and recurring issue for law enforcement. Security personnel never want to
  use an inappropriate level of defensive force. Innocent deaths must be avoided at all costs. However, inadequate
  solutions dramatically limit an officer's options.

  The Merr-Sonn AJ-23 is a highly regarded solution for crowd-control situations. Its boxy shape and carbine size make
  it both distinctive and easy to wield. It also confers an intimidating appearance that screams force, ensuring that
  targets recognize the wielder is armed and ready to take action.

  When fired, the AJ-23 releases a directed, but comparatively slow, blast of concussive force.  The force is
  sufficiently strong to knock down adults of most species but remains unlikely to cause serious injury. The fire
  pattern makes the weapon well suited to dealing with crowds but a poor solution for targeting a single perpetrator in
  a crowd.
