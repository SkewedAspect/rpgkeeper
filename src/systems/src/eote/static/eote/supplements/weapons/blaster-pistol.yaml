description: >-
  Most spacers carry standard blaster pistols. They pack enough punch to penetrate plastoid armor, have decent range,
  and are light enough to carry around at all times. Most scoundrels also appreciate the gunslinger-style look of a
  well-used blaster on their hip.

  Spacefarers who often have to fight aboard ship carry these weapons since the blast is effective against many types of
  armor, but isn't powerful enough to breach the hull of most vessels.

  **Models Include**: BlasTech DH-17 Blaster, BlasTech SE-14 and SE-14C Blaster Pistol.
