description: >-
  Merr-Sonn's LD-1 is the company's latest foray into the highly competitive long-range blaster market. It is an
  elegant, well built blaster rifle featuring a precision barrel, lightweight skeleton stock, and minimal foilfiber
  reinforced polycarbonate furniture. The weapon's firing mechanism is a slightly detuned version of Merr-Sonn's
  military-grade blaster system giving the rifle pinpoint accuracy and an incredible punch at extreme range. The LD-1 is
  also equipped with a Mk. 19 computer-aided macroscope with various optical enchancements and an Autosteady gyro-gimbal
  system to increase the weapon's performance at long and extreme ranges. It is easily disassembled and is sold with a
  custom-fit carrying case for transporting the rifle around in a relatively discreet fashion.

  Since its introduction, the LD-1 has become wildly popular. Its performance, power, and build quality are nearly
  unmatched in its segment. These qualities—combined with its official classification as a sporting blaster, which
  allows it to circumvent most weapon restrictions in the galaxy—have driven the LD-1 to consistently outsell the older
  SoroSuub X-45. In addition, aggressive marketing by Merr-Sonn and regular appearances on a popular HoloNet adventure
  drama proggram have established the LD-1 firmly in both military and popular culture.

  It is rumored that a variant called the LD-1a is produced in small numbers for the Imperial Security Bureau. The truth
  of these rumors has yet to be verified, but if there is a special ISB version of the LD-1, it would sell for a Moff's
  ransom on the black market should one ever appear there.
