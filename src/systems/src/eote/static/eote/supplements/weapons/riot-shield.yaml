description: >-
  Carried throughout the galaxy by law enforcement officers responding to riots and violent protests, riot shields are a
  symbol of faceless authority and, occasionally, oppression. The Actiw 1 by Drearian Defense is one of the most common
  models available in the Outer Rim. Worn strapped to an officer's non-dominant forearm, a riot shield averages around a
  meter long and nearly as wide, providing almost complete cover for a kneeling or crouching officer. They are
  constructed from a variety of materials. The shields are typically shaped in such a way as to help deflect incoming
  thrown objects and stand up to sustained fire from nearly any sidearm, although anything more powerful than a heavy
  blaster makes short work of a riot shield and the officer behind it. In addition to their obvious protective
  qualities, riot shields can be used as improvised, somewhat awkward melee weapons, allowing an officer to push and
  bash his way through a crowd if need be.

  Riot shields require one hand to wield, and so can only be used with pistols and one-handed melee weapons. Some riot
  shields incorporate a slot or mag-lock to allow the user to support a Ranged (Heavy) weapon with the shield itself
  (firing the weapon one-handed while wielding the riot shield in the other hand). A riot shield with this feature costs
  an additional 100 credits and has no hard points. Firing a rifle locked to the shield in this way is somewhat
  cumbersome, and adds <setback></setback> to combat checks with both weapons.
