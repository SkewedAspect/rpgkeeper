description: Designed to be used in conjunction with a vibrosword or other melee weapon, the blade-breaker is typically
  a small, serrated vibroblade or pronged dagger capable of catching and possibly even breaking an opponent's melee
  weapon. Equipped with an ultrasonic generator in the handle to increase the weapon's ability to shatter durasteel, a
  blade-breaker can quickly leave an opponent unarmed and at the mercy of its wielder.
