name: Double-Bladed Lightsaber
description: >-
  Known colloquially among Force adherents as lightstaffs or Sith lightsabers, the dangerous double-bladed I ightsabers
  were first designed by the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire. Double-bladed lightsabers consist of an oversized
  lightsaber hilt equipped with an upgraded power supply and twin emitter systems and crystals, one at either end of the
  hilt. When activated, a full-sized lightsaber blade springs from each emitter, making an exceptionally potent weapon
  nearly as long as a full-grown human. The weapon's twin blades allow a user to strike more rapidly, and sometimes
  fight multiple foes at once. Although quite dangerous and effective in combat, double-bladed lightsabers are also
  exceptionally difficult to master. Nevertheless, some Jedi constructed double-bladed lightsabers for themselves,
  including some notable figures in ancient Jedi myth.

  Although technically, this weapon contains two lightsaber crystals (one for each blade), for the purposes of gameplay
  it is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded
  Hum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points.

  When purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This
  represents the fact that the double-bladed lightsaber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end).
  However, when installing and modding these attachments, follow all normal rules.

  **Models Include:** None; each of these weapons is individually constructed.
