name: Mon Calamari Battle Baton
description: >-
  The Mon Calamari battle baton is a simple energy weapon in the shape of a ribbed scepter. Wielded as a symbol of
  status by Mon Cal officers, the baton provides an effective sidearm in an unassuming package. The ribs along the
  length of the baton indicate the wielder’s rank, which provides a visual indication

  of status to those nearby. More elaborate and decorative battle batons exist, but these are reserved for royalty and
  often incorporate precious metals, gems, and krakana pearls.

  Many Mon Calamari officers in the Rebel Alliance, including Admiral Ackbar, continue to carry the battle batons they
  were issued on Mon Cala.
