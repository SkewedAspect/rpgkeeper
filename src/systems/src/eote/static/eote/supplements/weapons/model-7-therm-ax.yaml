name: Model 7 Therm-Ax
description: >-
  Though similar in appearance to a vibro-ax, the SoroSuub Model 7 operates on very different principles. The ax head is
  crafted from a superconductive durasteel alloy, with thermal coils concealed just beneath the surface, running to the
  power supply located under the blade. When activated, the ax blade quickly reaches temperatures in excess of 500
  degrees. Even a glancing blow or near miss can ignite flammable materials, while a direct hit can incinerate flesh.
  Those wielding the weapon usually don heat-resistant garb, as their proximity to the blade can otherwise be quite
  unpleasant.

  A therm-ax requires two hands to wield.
