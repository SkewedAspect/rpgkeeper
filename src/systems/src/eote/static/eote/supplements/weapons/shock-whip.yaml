name: Shock Whip
description: The shock whip has been a mainstay of the Zygerrian Slave Empire for thousands of years. When it is
  activated, the flexible metal wires woven through the whip pulse with electrified energy, causing intense pain and
  muscle spasms on contact. While the whip can only ensnare one target at a time, the target takes continuous damage
  each round the target remains ensnared. This weapon can be used to make melee attacks against targets at short range.
