name: Blaster Rifle
description: >-
  The rifle or carbine blaster is the typical firearm of soldiers and heavy security forces around the galaxy. Their
  longer barrels propel bolts much farther than blaster pistols, and their heavier cartridges typically trigger a more
  powerful blast of particles.

  Stormtroopers in service of the Empire carry E-11 blaster rifles with folding stocks. At short range, the rifle can be
  fired one-handed—just as if it were a heavy pistol. The stock is extended when firing at more distant targets so that
  the trooper can better stabilize his aim.

  **Models Include**: E-11 Blaster Rifle (multiple manufacturers), BlasTech A280 Blaster Rifle.
