description: >-
  Extraordinarily difficult to wield and as dangerous to an untrained user as to their enemy, double-bladed vibroswords
  are a rare variant of the more familiar vibrosword. A double-bladed vibrosword consists of an extended hilt with
  full-Iength blades mounted at each end, for an overall length of up to three meters. In the hands of a skilled user, a
  double-bladed vibrosword is a deadly weapon perfectly suited to dueling multiple opponents.

  A double-bladed vibrosword requires two hands to wield.
