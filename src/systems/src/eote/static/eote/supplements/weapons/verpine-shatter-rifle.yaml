description: >-
  Verpine shatter guns are projectile weapons based on magnetic field technology, akin to rail guns. Shatter guns are
  nearly silent in their operation, though there is an audible crack as their metal alloy projectile breaks the speed of
  sound. Though the projectiles themselves are relatively small, the speed with which they impact the target inflicts a
  large amount of kinetic damage, and their effective range is exceptional.

  Shatter guns are available in a number of configurations, including pistols, rifles, and heavier versions

  that can serve as sniper weapons. The Verpine are a largely peaceful species, and since they rarely have any call for
  violence, they only manufacture a small number of shatter guns for their own internal security. The scarcity of
  shatter guns that make it beyond the Roche Asteroid Field, along with their lethality and relative untraceability,
  results in the exorbitant prices of available models.

  The Rebel Alliance has secured a small number of shatter guns from the Verpine and issues them on an as-needed basis
  to operatives in the field. Shatter guns are notoriously delicate and must be cared for properly. If a shatter gun is
  dropped or jarred, it will cease to function until repaired. While wielding a shatter gun, any combat check that
  generates either <threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> damages the weapon by one step, as if
  struck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the Ace of Rebellion Core Rulebook).
