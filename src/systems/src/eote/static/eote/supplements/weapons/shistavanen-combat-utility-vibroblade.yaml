description: >-
  The wilds of Uvena Prime can be harsh and unforgiving, and have claimed countless Shistavanen hunters. For this
  reason, Shistavanen survivalists devised an item with every conceivable tool necessary to survive in the wilderness
  and in battle, dubbed the "Combat Utility Vibroblade". Shistavanens say that no respectable surivalist would be caught
  dead without this handy gadget, though their opinion is often somwhat biased. Still, each C.U.V. is a custom
  configuration, equipped with eight different tools of the owner's choosing, and as such these devices are extremely
  useful in the wilds. Containing anything from a fire starter to a hydrospanner to a water contaminant detector, the
  C.U.V. is many a survivalist's best friend.

  The Combat Utility Vibroblade serves as a tool kit to allow Mechanics checks to repair devices and to "heal" droids,
  but adds <setback></setback> to such checks. Additionally, it adds <boost></boost> to the character's Survival checks.
