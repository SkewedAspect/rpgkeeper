name: Knockout Grenade
description: >-
  It is not always necessary or even desirable to kill a threat in order to neutralize it. While stun weapons are the
  most common nonlethal method of disabling a foe, they are by no means the only way to subdue an opponent. Knockout
  grenades are one method of incapacitating multiple targets without causing permanent damage. Filled with a
  tranquilizer gas, these grenades can quickly subdue most living things caught in their blast radius, sending them into
  a deep sleep. Poachers sometimes use grenades such as these to capture wild, dangerous predators, and knockout
  grenades can even take down large creatures if used in sufficient quantity.

  Knockout grenades have no effect on targets wearing breath masks or without respiratory systems.
