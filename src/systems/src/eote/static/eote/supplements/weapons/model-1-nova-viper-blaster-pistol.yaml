  Raider Arms Model-1 "Nova Viper" Blaster Pistol

  When weapon designer Joran Raider, the man behind many of the galaxy's most successful blasters, left BlasTech to
  start his own small manufacturing firm, it was a blow to the arms giant. Rumors persist that several notorious bounty
  hunters contracted by BlasTech to eliminate its former employee were bought off by Raider with examples of what many
  believe to be the pinnacle of his craft, the Model-1 Nova Viper blaster pistol. Perfectly balanced, innovative, and
  tooled down to a fraction of a micrometer, Raider Arms customizes every Nova Viper sold for its buyer, from its grip
  to its finish. As such, Nova Viper blasters are highly sought after and cost nearly as much as a new speeder. The
  blaster's incredible precision comes with a hidden price as well, requiring careful maintenance and exceptional skill
  to repair. Nonetheless, a fringer who manages to obtain a Nova Viper would almost invariably count himself lucky and
  consider it among his most valued possessions.
