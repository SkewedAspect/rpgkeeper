name: MMD-18 Molecular Dagger
description: >-
  The MMD-18 is a larger, more durable version of Xana Exotic Arms' MSW-9 molecular stiletto. Roughly the size of a
  combat knife, the MMD-18 has a long and thin double-edged, crystalline matrix blade set into a simple polycarbonate
  handle with a short, straight quillon. The edges of the blade are honed to mono-molecular thickness, allowing them to
  cut through even the thickest armor. While this dagger is sturdier than the MSW-9, a wrong move or an awkward blow can
  still shatter the blade relatively easily.

  Due to their inherent fragility, any combat check made while wielding one of these blades that generates either
  <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> shatters the blade.
