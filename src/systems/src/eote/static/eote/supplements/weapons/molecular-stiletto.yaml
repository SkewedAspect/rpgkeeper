name: Molecular Stiletto
description: >-
  Produced by Xana Exotic Arms, the MSW-9 is a small, easily concealable blade popular among professionals, politicians,
  and entertainers. Built to resemble a datapad stylus, the MSW-9 is light, inconspicuous, and easily overlooked by even
  the most zealous and dedicated search.

  Due to their inherent fragility, any combat check made while wielding one of these blades that generates either
  <threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> damages the weapon by one step as if struck by a weapon with
  the Sunder quality. Add <setback></setback> to a character's Perception check when attempting to find a molecular
  stiletto on a person's body.
