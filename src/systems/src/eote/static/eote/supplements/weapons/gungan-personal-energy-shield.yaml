name: Gungan Personal Energy Shield
description: >-
  Gungan engineering incorporates a particularly advanced understanding of shielding technologies. Their underwater
  cities make use of shielding extensively. Even their offensive weapons are designed around encasing a ball of
  high-energy plasma within a temporary energy shield. It is hardly surprising, then, that they are one of the few
  species that have successfully designed an easily portable defensive shield.

  The Gungan personal energy shield is sized to the wearer. It is worn on the user’s off-hand arm, so that a weapon can
  be wielded in the other. Notably, it does not completely encase the user in a secure field. Rather, it only offers
  defense against attacks coming from a single orientation. To benefit from the shield, the wielder must be able to
  focus on deflecting attacks.

  The value of the Gungan personal energy shield’s Defensive quality is reduced to 0 while the wielder is suffering from
  the staggered or disoriented condition.
