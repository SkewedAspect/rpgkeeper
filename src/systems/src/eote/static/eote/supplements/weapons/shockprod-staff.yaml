name: Shockprod Staff
description: >-
  The shockprod staff is the universally recognized symbol of the ancient tradition of Gand findsmen. Roughly as tall as
  a full-grown Gand, the shockprod staff is constructed of various alloys and equipped with a small, high-output power
  cell that generates a strong stun field. The top of the staff branches into a "V" shape. Electrodes at the tip of each
  branch focus the stun field and can be used to trap individuals or herd them wherever a findsman needs them to go. The
  staff can also fire a bolt of energy up to a few meters away, allowing the user to catch targets unaware or
  incapacitate particularly dangerous marks at a safe distance. Shockprod staffs are handmade by Gand findsmen and
  presented to new findsmen when they are initiated. Those that are available on the galactic arms market have been
  stolen, or looted from fallen Gands.

  A shockprod staff requires two hands to wield.
