  Mon Calamari Coral Pike

  The coral pike is an ancient weapon of the Mon Calamari people. Despite its status as a ceremonial weapon, the coral
  pike is an effective Melee weapon that combines elements of a force pike with Mon Calamari craftsmanship. Coral pike
  blades are crafted from a particularly dense breed of coral native only to Mon Cala. Once a craftsperson has defined
  the general shape of the blade, it is sharpened to a nearly monomolecular edge using precise lasers. The result is a
  unique weapon with an edge that never dulls.

  Every coral pike is made by hand, and no two are exactly alike. They are often carved with symbols

  denoting Mon Calamari rank and familial ties. For individuals who are considered friends of the Mon Calamari people,
  the gift of a coral pike is a great honor and represents an eternal bond that transcends species.
