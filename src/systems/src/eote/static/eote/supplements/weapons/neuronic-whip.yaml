name: Neuronic Whip
description: >-
  Used by slavers across the galaxy to keep their "merchandise" in line, the neuronic whip is a terrible weapon banned
  on many worlds. A powerful electrical charge runs the length of this cruel wire whip, discharging when it strikes its
  target and sending painful impulses racing through its victim's nerve cells. The whip emits an ominous low humming
  sound when charged, exploding like the crack of a gunshot when it comes into contact its unfortunate target.

  This weapon can be used to make melee attacks against targets at up to short range (the difficulty remains **Average
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>**).
