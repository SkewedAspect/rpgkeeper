  Kelvarek Consolidated Arms KD-30 "Dissuader" Pistol

  A particularly vicious slugthrower, the KD-30 "Dissuader" fires special ammunition filled with a particularly caustic
  acid capable of eating through armor, flesh, and bone. Outlawed in many "civilized" parts of the galaxy, the KD-30 is
  a disconcertingly common weapon in Hutt Space.

  The acid in the Dissuader's ammunition continues to cause damage over time. A target struck by a round from the KD-30
  suffers one wound, ignoring soak, at the beginning of his turn for the next two rounds.
