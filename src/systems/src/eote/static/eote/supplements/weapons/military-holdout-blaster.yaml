name: Military Holdout Blaster
description: >-
  Diplomats rarely fare as well as their allies in extended firefights or brawls, but sometimes, a single shot might be
  sufficient to enable escape from a perilous situation. Many governments, therefore, outfit representatives with more
  powerful versions of the oft-employed holdout blasters. Like the civilian variants, such weapons can be easily hidden
  and drawn quickly, allowing the user to get off an unexpected shot at a critical moment. Military models, by contrast,
  typically fire a more powerful blast, at the cost of limited ammunition capacity.

  Add <setback></setback> to a character's Perception checks to find a military holdout blaster on a person's body.
  During combat, GMs may make a military holdout blaster run out of ammunition by spending
  <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat>. This is in addition to the standard spending of
  <despair></despair>, as discussed on page 218 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook.

  **Models include:** Czerka Arms 411, BlasTech C-91.
