name: Snap Baton
description: Snap batons are light, collapsible truncheons often employed by law enforcers and bounty hunters. With
  little more than a flick of the wrist, the baton can be extended to its full one-meter length. Once extended, the
  baton's weighted end can be used to inflict serious injusry on opponents. Due to the nature of the baton's
  construction, it provides a colid and punishing weapon in a very small package. Collapsing a snap baton requires that
  a stud be depressed while the wielder pushed it back into the handle.
