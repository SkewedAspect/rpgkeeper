  Czerka "Peacekeeper" Stun Baton

  Czerka Arms sells "Peacekeeper" stun batons to law enforcement organizations across the galaxy, but they also see
  substantial sales to private buyers. While primarily marketed as a non-lethal weapon ideal for peacekeeping or
  self-defense, the truth is that the weapons are heavy lengths of metal with powerful shock capabilities that augment
  their use as bludgeons rather than raplacing them.

  While the goal of most similar weapons is to subdue with a minimum of force or damage, anyone dropped by "Peacemaker"
  batons is likely to feel the effects afterward. This has led to a number of more conscientious groups blacklisting the
  weapons or discontinuing their use, but many others have no such compunctions. Some Imperial governers have placed
  mass orders for the weapons to keep their populations in line, while many bounty hunters have turned to the weapons as
  an option that allows them to skirt laws or circumvent clients' requests regarding use of force or lethal weaponry.
