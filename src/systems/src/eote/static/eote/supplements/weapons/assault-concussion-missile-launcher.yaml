description: >-
  The assault concussion missile is a capital ship grade concussion missile in use by capital ships. Exponentially more
  powerful than smaller versions commonly used on starfighters, these heavy missiles are primarily used for planetary
  bombardment and anti-capital ship duty.

  A standard assault concussion missile could severely damage a capital ship, with rarely more than a handful being
  needed to destroy a target completely.
