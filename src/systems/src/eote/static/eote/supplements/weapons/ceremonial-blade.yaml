name: Ceremonial Blade
description: >-
  The presentation of weapons in various rituals has a strong root in many cultures, especially those with a
  militaristic past. Such practices usually stem from ancient history, so exchanges usually incorporate seemingly
  anachronistic armaments such as swords, axes, spears, or other such items. Such an award often signifies a high honor
  to the recipient, and many choose to include them in their formal dress for all future occasions. Naturally, given how
  highly prized such items are, they also often feature correspondingly high craftsmanship, with superior killing power
  in addition to beautiful design.
