name: Kal Dagger
description: The traditional accompaniment to the beskad, the kal is a short, deadly dagger typically wielded in a
  user's off hand. Forged entirely from beskar, the weapon consists of an elongated hexagonal blade with a rectangular
  cutout running along its center. The hilt is bare metal and has no crossguard, although the notch where the blade
  meets the hilt does provide some protection for the user's hand. While not as deadly as the beskad, the kal is still a
  formidable weapon in the hands of a skilled user.
