name: Reciprocating Quad Blaster Cannon
description: >-
  What is essentially a downscaled version of an anti-starfighter emplacement, the reciprocating quad blaster

  cannon is the heaviest personal weapon in Merr-Sonn

  Munitions’ entire arsenal. Developed during the Clone

  Wars, the “cip-quad” saw use by heavy weapons experts

  in elite divisions of the Grand Army of the Republic, such

  as the ARC Troopers. During the Galactic Civil War, most

  cip-quads are issued to Imperial heavy infantry supporting the Hell’s Hammers, an elite vanguard armor

  regiment. Few are acquired by the Rebellion, as they are

  nigh impossible to claim from fallen Hammers, and are

  rare and expensive on the black market.

  A reciprocating quad blaster cannon assembly uses

  a special pneumatic harness to secure and steady

  the weapon in front of the wearer. Further, a wielder

  generally equips a portable fusion generator (usually worn on the back) power the cannon. Dozens of

  micro-repulsors placed along the cip-quad mitigate

  some of the immense weight of the cannon, and inertial compensators reduce the intense recoil. Despite

  the built-in support, those inexperienced in the weapon's operation can suffer grievous recoil injuries if its

  sensitive compensators are not precisely calibrated.

  This weapon can only be used in Auto-fire mode.
