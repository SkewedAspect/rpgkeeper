name: RGL-318 Rotary Grenade Launcher
description: >-
  Grenade launchers are some of the most versatile weapons available on the market. The ability to chamber various types
  of offensive, defensive, and less-lethal rounds allows a shooter to react quickly to the vagaries of the galaxy's
  battlefields The RGL-318, by Locris Syndicates, is a highly respected weapon that has been in service for decades in
  militaries and law-enforcement agencies throughout the galaxy. A big, intimidating weapon, the RGL-318 is roughly
  carbine-sized, with a short, wide barrel and a folding stack. A rotating cylinder mounted forward of the trigger
  carries six grenades and can be loaded one chamber at a time or dropped and instantly replaced with a fresh cylinder.

  The weapon's listed price does not include ammunition. Grenades for the RGL-318 cost the same as equivalent hand
  grenades, but many dealers offer a 50-percent discount on cases of six. Any type of grenade can be chambered by the
  RGL-318, but the grenades must be specifically made to be fired from a grenade launcher. Launcher grenades cannot be
  thrown. The listed profile represents an RGL-318 loaded with standard frag grenades.
