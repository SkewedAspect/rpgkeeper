name: SE-14r Light Repeating Blaster
description: >-
  The BlasTech SE-14r, also known as the Imperial repeating pistol, combines the portability and ease of use of a
  blaster pistol with a high rate of fire. These weapons are carried as side arms by some Imperial officers (including
  some stormtrooper commanders) and pilots. Manufactured specifically for Imperial forces, some of these weapons
  inevitably find their way onto the black market, where they fetch a high price.

  Due to its high rate of fire, the SE-14r is more likely to run out of ammo during an extended firelight or series of
  engagements. The GM may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> to cause a character's SE-14r to run
  out of ammo.
