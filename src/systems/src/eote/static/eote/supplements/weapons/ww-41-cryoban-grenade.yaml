  Merr-Sonn WW-41 CryoBan Grenade

  CryoBan is one of a number of chemical compounds used in the carbon freezing process. In its processed form, it
  creates intense, damaging cold by absorbing all heat in a given area. The WW-41 CryoBan grenade by Merr-Sonn was
  initially designed as an emergency fire-suppression tool and was used to put out fires aboard ships and space
  stations. The grenades resemble short, tapering batons with a ring at the smaller end. When they detonate, WW-41
  grenades spray everything in their blast radius with supercooled CryoBan. These grenades also make excellent area
  denial weapons, as they can harm living organisms through shock, frostbite, and nerve damage.
