name: CR-2 Heavy Blaster Pistol
description: Produced by Corellian Arms, the CR-2 heavy blaster pistol is a somewhat outdated weapon. Though no longer
  in production, the CR-2 is still used by several police and security forces throughout the galaxy. Firing a focused
  beam of charged plasma, the CR-2 is reliable and easy to maintain. The blaster is usually fitted with a second
  under-barrel forearm grip to increase its firing stability.
