  Nova Design "Impact" Repulsor Cannon

  Despite the ubiquity of repulsorlift technology across the galaxy, the  particular variant of design that resulted in
  repulsor cannons rarely sees production or use outside of specialty weapon manufacturers such as Nova Design Arms.
  Produced by a company specializing in unusual armaments as an alternative to stun or riot blasters, the weapons have a
  reputation as inferior options for a non-lethal weapon. The gravitic disruptions the weapons create are capable of
  disabling a target from nearly any action if focused properly, but this disabling effect only lasts as long as the
  weapons remain focused on their targets.

  Some cunning bounty hunters have adopted these weapons as tools to disable a target while partners or associates move
  in with binders for a clean capture. As such, lone hunters rarely use this weapon, but it is a relatively common sight
  in the hands of bounty hunters who regularly work with a posse, especially as a backup weapon or a specialist tool
  they bring along only for specific jobs. It enables bounty hunter teams to use various unconventional tactics to bring
  in difficult targets, so it has a popular following in spite of its limitations.
