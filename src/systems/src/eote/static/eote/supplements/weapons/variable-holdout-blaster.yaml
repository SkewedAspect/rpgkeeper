name: Variable Holdout Blaster
description: >-
  The variable holdout blaster is a sleek, easily concealable design with a variable power setting. The pistol has been
  popular with spies, informants, and covert Rebels on the planet of Ord Gimmel for some time. The power level of the
  weapon’s blast is adjustable, allowing for more or less damage capacity as desired by the user. The tradeoff for the
  weapon’s combination of utility and concealability is that the pistol’s power cell is limited.

  When firing the weapon, the pistol’s wielder must choose a power setting between 1 and 7. This is the amount of damage
  a successful shot inflicts on a target, but it is also the amount of ammo that is consumed for the shot. If set to a
  power setting higher than the available ammo left, the weapon deals damage equal to the amount of ammo remaining.

  Anyone searching an individual carrying a concealed variable holdout blaster adds <setback></setback> to their
  Perception checks.
