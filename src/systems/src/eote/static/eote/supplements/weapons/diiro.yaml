name: Diiro
description: >-
  The diiro is a common Arbooinian weapon, tailored to the needs of the Sathari. The weapon consists of a hollow but
  sturdy haft of wood about a meter long, tipped with a small but very sharp alloy blade. The diiro is lightweight but
  capable of deadly precision strikes in the hands of a skilled user. To further cut down on weight, blades of most
  diiros are also hollow. In many cases, they contain a reservoir of venom extracted from a bearsloth, a zabros, or
  another of Arbooine's unique plants and animals. This ensures that although the cuts delivered by a diiro are seldom
  sever on their own, the weapon is nonetheless capable of bringing down even the largest of Arbooinian predators in
  short order.

  A diiro can be loaded with up to three doses of any poison. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target with a
  diiro (whether or not damage is dealt), the target also suffers the effects of being exposed to the poison it
  contains.

  Due to its lightweight construction, when a diiro suffers one or more levels of damage due to a <despair></despair>
  result on a combat check or the effects of the Sunder quality, it recieves one additonal level of damage.

  _Note: The diiro may only be found on Arbooine._
