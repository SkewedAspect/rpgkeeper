description: >-
  Lightwhips are, perhaps, the rarest and most bizarre of the numerous lightsaber veriants. Highly modified lightsabers,
  lightwhips consist of a short lightsaber haft built from alloys or composites laced with either cortosis or phrik.
  Their internals are modified in such a way that the plasma's continment field is more flexible, allowing each emitter
  to create thin, snaking, fluid blades several meters in length. These modifications also have an unintended side
  effect of reducing the raw damage output and striking capabilities. Once active, lightwhips can both deal damage and
  capture or entangle an opponent. Due to the instability of the energy blades, though, lightwhips are extraordinarily
  hard to master and can be more of a danger to their users than their opponents.

  When the character using a lightwhip makes a successful Lightsaber combat check, she may spend
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> or <triumph></triumph> to prevent her opponent from using the Parry
  incidental to reduce damage. A user may not add lightsaber crystal attachments to a lightwhip, and cannot use a
  lightwhip to parry or reflect attacks.
