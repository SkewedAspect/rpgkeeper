name: SKZ Sporting Blaster Rifle
description: The Corellian Arms SKZ Sporting Blaster is a popular civilian weapon used for hunting and self-defense. A
  relatively compact and simple design that has been in production for centuries, the SKZ doesn't have the power of
  military grade blaster rifles, but has good range and is capable of bringing down all but the largest game. The SKZ
  comes with a rail system for easily adding attachments and can be quickly broken down into three parts for transport
  in a small case.
