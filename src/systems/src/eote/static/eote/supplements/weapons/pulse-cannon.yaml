description: |-
  After its wide-scale implementation by the Galactic
  Empire, the simplicity and versatility of BlasTech’s
  E-11 blaster rifle spawned several offshoot designs,
  the most popular of which was the so-called pulse
  cannon. The pulse cannon consists of a core frame
  similar to the E-11, but replaces the folding stock with
  a solid one for added stability, and a high-powered
  scope. It also features a long, perforated barrel with
  four focusing coils to ensure proper cooling and to
  allow maximum blaster bolt cohesion. Further adding to its lethality, a wielder can “charge” an individual
  shot by holding down the trigger, unleashing a devastating shot upon release that drains the weapon’s
  entire energy reserve.
  As a maneuver, a character wielding a pulse cannon
  may prime the weapon to expend all of its ammunition
  in a single, devastating shot. The next time the weapon
  is fired this encounter, it counts as having the Breach
  1 and Vicious 3 qualities. After being discharged this
  way, the weapon runs out of ammunition (see page
  172 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).
