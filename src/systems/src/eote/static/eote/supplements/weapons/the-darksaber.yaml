name: The Darksaber
description: >-
  This ancient weapon is unlike any other known lightsaber. Its hilt emits a thin curved blade of utter blackness with a
  halo of white energy, rather than the colorful glowing blades of other lightsabers. Legend has that the first
  Mandalorian Jedi fashioned it centuries ago. Many have used it over the ages, from the Jedi of old to the Mandalorians
  who stole it from their temple and made it a symbol of House Vizla. Recently, it has been sighted on Dathomir and has
  come into the possession of Sabine Wren-a descendant of that House. Whether she knows the significance of her newest
  weapon, or what she might do it she does, remains to be seen.

  The Darksaber is a unique item and has the following profile: (Lightsaber; Damage 6; Critical 2; Range [Engaged];
  Accurate 1, Breach 1, Defensive 1, Sunder). The crystal has all of its mods applied and the hilt has no hard points.
  While the user openly displays the weapon, add automatic <success></success><advantage></advantage> to social skill
  checks that character makes against Mandalorian characters.
