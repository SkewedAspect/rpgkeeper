name: Great Lightsaber
description: >-
  Great lightsabers are oversized lightsabers built for use by individuals with large, powerful frames. Heavy, often
  awkward and difficult-to-use weapons, they feature reinforced hilts with heavy-duty power and emitter systems that
  produce blades in excess of two meters long. Their heavier hilts and more powerful blades, combined with the natural
  strength of their intended users, make these massive lightsabers even more potent and deadly than their smaller
  cousins. Because great Ilghtsabers are built for large and powerful beings, individuals of human size or smaller find
  it difficult to wield one with any kind of effectiveness.

  This weapon's profile represents a great lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Ilum crystal. This crystal occupies
  two of the weapon's

  hard points.

  When installing a lightsaber crystal into a great lightsaber, increase the damage of that lightsaber crystal by 1.
