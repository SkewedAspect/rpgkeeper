name: Tuskbeast Pike
description: >-
  Long spears used by the Nikto, tuskbeast pikes were originally developed to hunt the giant, mutated predators of
  Kintan. Though tuskbeasts are now extinct, many Nikto still carry these weapons. Traditionally, the polearms' hafts
  are carved from slain tuskbeasts' ivory and bone, often elaborately carved with sacred images and poetry from Nikto
  mythology.

  The tuskbeast pike requires two hands to wield.
