  Mon Calamari Energy Lance
     

  Wielded by the Mon Calamari Knights during the Clone Wars, energy lances are designed to be used from atop a mount.
  Essentially force pikes equipped with electromagnetic pulse generators, they are primarily intended for use against
  droids and vehicles. Despite this specialization, they are perfectly capable of inflicting grievous damage on organic
  targets.


  Former members of the Mon Calamari Knights still carry their lances with them, especially when fighting mounted
  against droids and vehicles. Reflecting the strict requirements of knighthood among the Mon Cal, these lances are
  symbols of their duty and commitment to their people.


  If he is mounted, the wielder of an energy lance may use his steed’s Brawn rating to determine the damage of this
  weapon instead of his own Brawn rating. If the wielder is not mounted, the weapon has the Cumbersome 3 quality.
