name: Z50 Grenade Launcher
description: >-
  The Z50 from Malaxan Firepower Incorporated is a powerful weapon that can be readily handled by a single user. A
  grenade launcher fires explosive projectiles that have power equivalent to hand grenades. While less powerful and
  without the firing options of a missile tube, the Z50 is also much lighter and can be carried more easily. The
  grenades are also smaller, allowing smaller weapons to carry the same or more shots.

  The listed price does not include ammunition. Grenades for a grenade launcher cost the same as equivalent hand
  grenades, though many merchants offer a 50 percent discount on cases of six. The weapon can fire any grenade, although
  the grenade launcher projectiles are different than hand grenades (grenade launcher projectiles also cannot be thrown,
  they must be fired from the grenade launcher). The character should specify what type of grenades he wants when
  purchasing them. The listed profile for the grenade launcher represents the weapon loaded with standard frag grenades
  (see the **Edge of the Empire** Core,Rulebook, page 160).
