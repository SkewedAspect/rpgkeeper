name: SK-44 Plasma Missile
description: When primed, a store of high-energy gas within the plasma warhead is converted into a highly volatile
  plasma state. The operation of a plasma missile is actually very similar to that of a blaster, and the resulting
  detonation is not unlike the impact of a blaster bolt, albeit magnified tenfold. The trade-off of this weapon is that
  the unstable warhead detonates after a brief flight time whether it hits its target or not, making the effective range
  relatively short.
