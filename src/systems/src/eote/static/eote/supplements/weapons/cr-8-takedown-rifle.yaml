  Corellian Arms CR-8 Takedown Rifle

  The CR-8 is a high-performance blaster rifle designed for use by CorSec snipers and secret agents. Built to exacting
  specifications by Corellian Arms, the CR-8 is a long, deadly looking weapon designed for pinpoint accuracy at very
  long ranges. Just shy of two meters in length, the CR-8 is equipped with a precision barrel, lightweight, matte finish
  composite furniture, and a highpowered sight. It also features an integrated energy damper that reduces its report and
  muzzle flash. The weapon's firing system uses a supercharged actuator, upgraded XCiter, and a high-output proprietary
  blaster gas. These modifications increase power and reduce beam refraction and degradation, allowing the weapon to
  accurately hit targets at ranges well beyond normal blaster rifle range. The downside is that the weapon produces an
  inordinate amount of heat, which it must offset with a low rate of fire.

  Perhaps the CR-8's most unique aspect is its transportability, the weapon is designed to be broken down into its core
  components quickly  and easily. with just a few moments of work, the CR-8 can be disassembled into five separate
  components: berrel, stock, reciever, sight, and energy damper. Obstensibly, this feature was added to the weapon to
  assist in carrying and storing it. As an added side effect, however, the takedown feature makes these weapons
  extremely easy to hide and very attractive for professional killers. A CR-8 is nearly impossible to find when hidden,
  thanks to the takedown feature and its unique finish.

  Perception checks made to find it on a person's body.
