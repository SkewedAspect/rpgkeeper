  Air rifles are not considered weapons on most planets in the galaxy, and the majority of sentients therein see them as
  little more than toys. Even those Core Worlds with the most draconian restrictions on weapon ownership have no
  official laws governing air-powered weapons. A specialized form of slugthrower, air rifles use compressed air or other
  gasses to propel tiny metal pellets or light, spin-stabilized darts over long distances. Lightweight and extremely
  accurate, they are usually marketed to hobby shooters, collectors, or those who need a quiet, easy-to-use, and
  relatively safe weapon with which to practice their marksmanship.

  These weapons' balance, accuracy, portability, and the nearly complete silence of their firing mechanism make them
  excellent weapons for hunters, both of beasts and of sentient beings. Combined with the ability to chamber specialty
  darts that can be filled with various chemicals and toxins, air weapons make for fine silent killing weapons.

  One of the most common air rifles on the market is the Model 77 from Field Sports, a trusted name in air-weapon
  production. Known colloquially as the Sandman, thanks to the unique effects of its standard ammunition, the Model 77
  is a lightweight, long-barreled air gun similar in silhouette and stature to a sporting blaster. Made primarily of
  polycarbonate with fibermesh reinforcement, the Model 77 was initially marketed as a nonlethal weapon for animal
  control and law enforcement. It fires tiny, spin-stabilized darts with laser-honed tips capable of piercing the
  thickest hide from a detachable clip that is quick and easy to reload. Each dart contains a dose of tranquilizer agent
  that induces unconsciousness. In addition, the Model 77's darts can be loaded with the heavy-duty "SmartTranq"
  tranquilizer with an active ingredient that adapts itself upon contact with the target's bloodstream to be as
  effective as possible no matter what the species. Sandman air rifles have a well-deserved reputation for accuracy and
  reliability. In the Outer Rim many are used by bounty hunters and big-game hunters who need to take prey alive in
  order to collect their payments.
