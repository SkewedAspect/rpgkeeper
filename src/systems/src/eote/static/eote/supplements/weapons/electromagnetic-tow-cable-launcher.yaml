name: Electromagnetic Tow Cable Launcher
description: >-
  While capital ships can rely on tractor beams to ensnare and immobilize targets, these weapons are not generally an
  option for smaller vessels and ground vehicles. For such vehicles, the closest approximation is often the tow cable
  launcher. This catchall term encompasses a number of different devices with similar function. The most common models
  incorporate an electromagnetic grapple and a length of durasteel cable fired by a hydraulic launcher.

  Although these launchers were originally designed as tools rather than weapons, a number of desperate or inventive
  pilots have made use of these grapple launchers in combat over the years. Members of the Rebel Alliance are accustomed
  to making do with whatever tools they have at their disposal, and a number of non-combat vehicles sporting tow cables
  have seen use in battle. In fact, some commanders find the tactical uses for these tools versatile enough to
  specifically request their addition to combat vehicles.
