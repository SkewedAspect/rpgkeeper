name: Shaped Thermal Grenade
description: |-
  A favorite of marines and special forces, the shaped
  thermal grenade is a shaped sequencer charge capable of vaporizing virtually any target. It uses similar
  technology to a thermal detonator, but focuses the
  blast in a single direction to maximize damage to a
  specific object. Both the Empire and Rebellion use
  the shaped thermal grenade to obliterate structures
  and punch through heavy armor. However, the sheer
  cost of these deadly explosives means that they are
  deployed sparingly, at least by supply-conscious organizations like the Alliance to Restore the Republic.
