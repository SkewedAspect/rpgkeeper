  DR-45 "Dragoon" Calvalry Blaster


  The DR-45 cavalry blaster by Merr-Sonn is one of a line of convertible blaster carbines marketed to vehicle crews and
  beast riders. Based on Merr-Sonris popular DD6 blaster pistol, the DR-45, also called the Dragoon, is marketed as an
  all-in-one weapon providing the portability of a blaster pistol with the range and stopping power of a blaster
  carbine. To accomplish this, the base weapon, which is a long-barreled blaster pistol, can be fitted with a detachable
  polycarbonate shoulder stock and a range-extending augmented spin barrel to turn it into a respectably effective
  blaster carbine. The stock and barrel are fixed to the base weapon with sturdy quick-release mounts that allow an
  experienced user to mount or dismount the attachments quickly and easily. While not particularly common, Dragoon
  cavalry blasters are slowly finding a following among members of the Rebel Alliance who value their versatility,
  reliability, and stopping power. 


  Converting the DR-45 from a pistol to a carbine takes one maneuver and changes the weapon's combat skill from Ranged
  (Light) to Ranged (Heavy). Similarly, it takes one maneuver to convert the weapon back, restoring its combat skill to
  Ranged (Light).
