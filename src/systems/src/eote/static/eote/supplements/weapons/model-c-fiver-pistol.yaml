name: Model C "Fiver" Pistol
description: The Xet Model C incorporates a five-round internal cylinder magazine. Even by the standards of
  slugthrowers, this weapon is time-consuming to reload, as each high-caliber round must be inserted individually. Yet
  despite its limitations, the Model C is popular with some Hired Guns who find an aesthetic pleasure in its unusual
  operation. It must be said that the Model C is a dangerous weapon, at least for a slugthrower, with high stopping
  power due to its large-bore chamber. However, a combatant wielding a Model C must make every shot count if he hopes to
  triumph over an enemy with a more sophisticated weapon. Most consider this weapon a curiosity at best, a museum piece
  at worst.
