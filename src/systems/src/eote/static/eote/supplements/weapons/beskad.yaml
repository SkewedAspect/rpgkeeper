name: Beskad
description: Beskads are traditional Mandalorian sabers forged from beskar, or Mandalorian iron. Based on an ancient
  Taung design, these heavy, single-handed short swords are often unfavorably compared to the common machete. They have
  a broad, single-edged blade about the length of a grown human's arm mounted to a simple hilt with a rectangular
  crossguard. The blade's cutting edge curves sharply to a point, and its opposite side runs straight from hilt to tip.
  Designed to crack armor, these powerful blades are used like the humble machetes to which they are compared - to
  deliver short, powerful slashes.
