name: Arg'garok
description: >-
  Based on the traditional Camorrean war ax, the Arg'garok is a massive vibro-ax capable of inflicting horrific wounds.
  Favored by Camorrean warriors, these weapons are heavy and ungainly, measuring a meter and a half in length and
  requiring tremendous strength to properly wield in combat. In spite of the weapons' association with Gamorreans,
  Arg'garoks are highly valued as prestige weapons and can occasionally be found in the hands of Barabels or Houks in
  the employ of the Hutt kajidics—more physical and belligerent Hutts might even brandish such weapons themselves.

  The Arg'garok requires two hands to wield.
