name: ACP Array Gun
description: A favorite weapon of pirates, the somewhat crude-looking Arakyd Accelerated Charged Particle Array Gun is a
  short-range blaster useful for clearing the halls and corridors of starships. With a specialized galven coil and
  prismatic crystal array at the end of the actuating module, blasts from an ACP Array split into a wide spray pattern
  on exiting the barrel. Though only effective at short ranges, in the narrow passageways and closed spaces of a
  starship, these weapons can be devastating and are frequently employed by shock troops and pirates during boarding
  actions.
