name: Anti-Personnel Mine
description: >-
  Simple, deadly weapons deployed by countless military and paramilitary forces throughout the galaxy, anti-personnel
  mines are, outside of hand grenades, the most common portable ordnance in use. Cheap, easy to use, and frightfully
  efficient weapons, anti-personnel mines come in a number of forms, from simple explosive devices buried in the ground
  that detonate when stepped on to sophisticated weapons that fire blaster bolts, gouts of fire, clouds of shrapnel, or
  other deadly ordnance designed to shred squads of approaching infantry. Much smaller and lighter than anti-vehicle
  mines, one or two anti-personnel mines can easily be carried by a single trooper. They are usually deployed with their
  larger cousins around fortifications and on the battlefield to protect assets or disrupt enemy troop movement, or as
  part of booby traps or sabotage. The major drawback to anti-personnel mines is, much like flame projectors and thermal
  detonators, they can inadvertently target allies. In addition, the production and use of these weapons is banned on
  many worlds due to the fact that unexploded mines can remain active and ready to kill on battlefields well after the
  fighting is over.
