name: Styanax Lance
description: A large, vicious harpoon gun, the styanax lance has been used by countless generations of stabmen to hunt
  the ferocious sea serpents that haunt the stormy Sea of Jarad on Tralus. Mounted at the bows of their nagaks (the
  wide-hulled, oar-powered boats used by the human and Selonian seafarers of Tralus), the styanax lance is a
  meter-and-a-half long harpoon with a sharp, barbed durasteel tip designed to penetrate the armored scales and tough
  skin of the styanax. Thrown by the strong arms of the stabmen, the lance is attached to a stout flexisteel cable about
  two hundred meters long, which the stabmen use to haul in their prey. Rarely seen outside of Tralus, the styanax lance
  is occasionally used by off-world big game hunters on safari to bring down particularly large beasts, such as giant
  gundarks or bull rancors.
