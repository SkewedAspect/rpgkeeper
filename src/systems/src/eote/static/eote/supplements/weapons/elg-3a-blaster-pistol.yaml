name: ELG-3A Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  The ELG-3A differs slightly from the Merr-Sonn 02 model of blaster pistol, but shares the traits of being lightweight
  and distinctively elegant in design. Considered by many to be a "diplomat's blaster," the ELG-3A was particularly
  popular among Naboo's Royal Security Force. Like a holdout blaster, the weapon is easily concealable, but its longer
  barrel gives it better precision than many holdout pistols—a necessary trait given that the weapon's relatively light
  power necessitates especially accurate marksmanship to ensure fatal wounds.
