name: S-1 Vamblade (Paired)
description: >-
  Falling somewhere between brass knuckles and a sword, vamblades are dagger-length blades extending from durasteel
  vambraces, which provide a degree of protection to the wielder's forearms in a knife fight, as well as mounting the
  blade itself. The S-1 from Prax Arms includes a magnetic locking mechanism, allowing the user to retract or extend the
  blade with a simple flick of his wrist. When retracted, the blade can easily be hidden under a heavy coat, robe, or
  similar garb, making these weapons a favorite of assassins.

  Wrist blades are designed to be worn as a pair, and open up a whole range of combat options when used thus by a
  properly-trained fighter. When used as a pair, wrist blades gain the Sunder and Accurate 1 weapon qualities. (This
  applies even if they are not used with two weapon combat rules to gain an additional hit.) Vamblades cannot deal
  damage to a target's strain threshold.
