name: Laser Cannon
description: A laser cannon is the standard weapon for use by most starships and other vehicles. It exists in a myriad
  of forms, from the huge versions used by starships, through medium-sized turret-mounted variants, to the much smaller
  personal cannons sometimes carried by infantry. Although they are capable of causing a considerable amount of damage,
  they are no match to some of the more advanced beam weapons such as electromagnetic plasma cannons, turbolasers and
  superlasers.
