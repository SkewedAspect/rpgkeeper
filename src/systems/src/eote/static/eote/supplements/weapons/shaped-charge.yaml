name: Shaped Charge
description: >-
  Shaped charges are specially designed demolitions devices intended for pinpoint destruction. Such devices consist of a
  sizable detonite charge enclosed in a cone-shaped plasteel casing. When the charge is detonated, the specially shaped
  casing focuses the force of the explosion in a small area, creating a powerful jet of fine plasteel particles and
  kinetic energy that can cut through the strongest materials. Shaped charges are typically used to destroy buildings
  and other structures by cutting through load-bearing and structural members. They can also be used to bore holes,
  destroy obstacles, and even create ersatz anti vehicle mines.

  Shaped charges have the Breach 1 and Vicious 1 qualities, both of which increase by one for every additional shaped
  charge used.
