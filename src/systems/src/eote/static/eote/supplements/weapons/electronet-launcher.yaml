name: Electronet Launcher
description: An ideal weapon for subduing most sentient beings, the electronet launcher uses the same concept as a
  conventional net launcher, but without the tangles mess of a physical net. When fired, it projects a web of
  ever-widening charged ionic particles, somwhat like the Stun setting on a blaster. On contact, it envelopes targets,
  obstructing their movement while delivering a powerful Stun blast until the net dissipates. Electronet launchers are
  popular with Thalassian and Trandoshan slavers.
