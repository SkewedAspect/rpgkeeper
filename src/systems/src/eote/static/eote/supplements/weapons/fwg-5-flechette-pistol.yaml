name: FWG-5 Flechette Pistol
description: Manufactured by Malaxan Firepower Incorporated, the FWG-5 is a smaller, pistol-sized improvement on
  flechette launchers made by larger firms such as Golan Arms and the Salus Corporation. Firing a small canister or
  pellet filled with scores of tiny needle-like darts known as flechettes, the FWG-5 is a lethal and terrifying weapon.
  Effective even against armored targets, the pellets explode with tremendous energy upon hitting from their target,
  propelling the flechettes to tremendous speeds. Additionally, a laser-tracking system built into the weapon guides the
  pellets to their targets, allowing them to make minor adjustments in flight before showering their victims with a hail
  of deadly flechettes. Though outlawed in many systems, more than a few Smugglers keep an FWG-5 handy at all times.
