description: >-
  Touted as a revolution in light blaster design, Merr-Sonn's Q4 Quickfire is one of the more unique hold-out blasters
  on the market today. Instead of the typical gas chamber and energy cell power supply, the Q4 possesses an integral
  rechargeable power pack that provides more stopping power and a higher cyclic rate of fire than other holdouts. The
  trade-off for this extra power is the fact that the power pack must be recharged instead of easily replaced (a process
  that takes ten minutes), as well as the weapon's dismal performance at anything farther than short range.

  Add <setback></setback> to a character's Perception checks when attempting to find a 04 Quickfire on a person's body.
  If this weapon runs out of ammo due to a <despair></despair> result, it may not be reloaded by Extra Reloads, the
  Spare Clip talent, or other means.
