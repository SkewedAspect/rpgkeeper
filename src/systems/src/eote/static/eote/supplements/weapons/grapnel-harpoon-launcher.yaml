name: Grapnel-Harpoon Launcher
description: Commonly thought of as tools for climbing or lifting cargo, the weapons division of Pharr Co. instead
  produces grapnel launchers with the balance and targeting capablities necessary for combat use, allowing their users
  entangle opponents in a binding cord. Although sometimes used by thieves who don't like the idea of their victems
  fighting back, these grapnel guns see more use by bounty hunters or even law enforcement agents, assisting in the
  capture of their quarries. Although viewed as a non-lethal option, the magnetic firing mechanism of a grapnel is
  powerful enough to inflict injuries on the targets it ensnares. Generally, such wounds are superficial, and thus don't
  threaten the target's life—or more importantly, the bounty hunter's chances of getting paid in full.
