name: Gaffi Stick
description: >-
  The Tusken Raiders of Tatooine carry brutal staves made from desert tracti hardwood, krayt dragon horn or bone, or
  scavenged metal. One end of the gaffi stick is flanged with four protruding blades useful for cutting and gashing
  opponents. The other end curves outward and ends in a spike of some sort, with the opposite side serving as a dull
  club. While to some the gaffi stick seems crude, its genius is its versatility—being able to stab, cut, or club
  depending on how the user wields it. It has practical uses as well, from serving as a walking stick in the rough
  terrain of Tatooine to guiding the Tusken Raiders' massive banthas.

  Gaffi sticks require two hands to wield.
