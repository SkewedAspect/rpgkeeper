  Nightsinger Blaster Rifle

  Xerrol Corporation's Nightstinger is one of the most unusual blaster rifles in the galaxy. Officially classified as a
  sporting weapon, the Nightstinger is a powerful, well-balanced rifle ostensibly designed to hunt big, dangerous
  creatures at long distances. While this is true, the Nightstinger can also, at the flick of a switch, fire completely
  invisible blaster bolts, an ability that makes these weapons illegal to own in most civilized parts of the galaxy.
  While Xerrol claims that the invisible bolt setting was designed for night hunting and stalking light-sensitive
  beasts, the fact that it allows a shooter to remain completely undetected while firing has not been overlooked by the
  galaxy's assassins and intelligence agents. The power requirements for firing the rifle in stealth mode are quite
  onerous, however, and its rate of fire becomes significantly reduced from the depletion of its power cells.

  Switching the Nightstinger to stealth mode requires a maneuver. This makes locating the shooter by tracing the blaster
  bolt or spotting a muzzle blast effectively impossible. It also grants the weapon the Slow Firing 2 quality for the
  remainder of the encounter.
