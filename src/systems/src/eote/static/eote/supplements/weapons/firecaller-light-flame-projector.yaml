name: '"Firecaller" Light Flame Projector'
description: >-
  Merr-Sonn's "Firecaller" model flame projectors have inspired almost as much fear and revulsion among those who have
  encountered them as disruptors, despite the long and infamous history of disintegrators. Under a galactic government
  more concerned with sapient rights and well-being than the Empire, authorities might have banned these dreadful
  weapons already; some individual planetary governments have taken that step on their own. As such, Firecallers have
  tremendous appeal to criminals, bounty hunters, and those who are drawn towards such a repuation.

  The reason for the Firecallers' infamy lies in its unconventional fuel, an accelerite derivative abandoned by the
  company's starship designers as too unstable for use in their work. The highly flammable chemical substance burns at
  an incredibly high temperature and for an extended period compared to the typical fuels used in flame projectors.
  Although each blast from these weapons releases only a small spray of the chemical in order to prevent dangerous
  blowback, even this limited exposure causes devastating wounds over time as it burns its way through armor and
  protective gear to inflict terrible harm on now-exposed flesh.
