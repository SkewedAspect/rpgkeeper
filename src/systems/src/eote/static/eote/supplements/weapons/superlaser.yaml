description: >-
  The Mk I Superlaser developed for the Death Star is the most powerful weapon in the galaxy. Utilizing the unique
  energy-focusing qualities of refined kyber crystals and powered by four huge animatter generators, this weapon has the
  ability to completely destroy planets with a single blast.

  The superlaser has no damage or critical rating, yet deals damage. Its destructive power is on such a level that it
  transcends mere numbers. When the Death Star fires its superlaser, everything in its path is utterly destroyed. Even
  when using the energy from a single reactor, it can crater cities and devastate huge swaths of a planet's surface.

  The damage that this massive weapon can dish out is more narrative that mechanical. If the players ever encounter the
  Death Star and see the superlaser in action, the Game Master should describe ships burning to ash as it they were
  paper, whole worlds obliterated in the blink of an eye, shockwaves and strange localized hyperspace anomalies, and
  other terrible consequences. Force-sensitives, for example, might become disoriented from the death cries of an entire
  city's population. If the Player Characters are ever targeted by the Death Star's superlaser, the Game Master should
  find a way to allow them to escape what would be certain death, perhaps by making suitably heroic Piloting (Space)
  checks or spending Destiny Points.
