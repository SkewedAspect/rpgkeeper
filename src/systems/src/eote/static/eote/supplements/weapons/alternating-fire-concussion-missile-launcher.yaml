name: Alternating-Fire Concussion Missile Launcher
description: The more common and less powerful of the two types of shipboard ordnance, concussion missiles are found on
  all manner of spacecraft, from tiny starfighters to capital ships. Roughly a meter long, a concussion missile employs
  special warheads, combining a hardened durasteel penetrator that uses kinetic force to pierce through a ship's armor
  and a shaped high-explosive charge that causes damage through both explosive force and concussive shock. Concussion
  missiles are primarily anti-fighter weapons, used to quickly deal crippling damage to starfighters and patrol boats,
  although they perform well against larger targets as well.
