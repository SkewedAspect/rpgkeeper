name: PB08 Heavy Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  One of the more popular pistols on the market, Merr-Sonn's PB08 was designed as a direct competitor to BlasTech's
  DL-44. Simple and reliable, the PB08 is a sturdy, large framed blaster pistol with a short ventilated barrel that
  delivers excellent damage and penetration over short ranges. What makes the PB08 stand out from the crowd is its heat
  management and energy conservation systems. Most heavy blaster pistols, especially the DL-44, have a nasty tendency to
  overheat or run out of blaster gas at the most inopportune times. Merr-Sonn's designers eliminated these drawbacks
  from the PB08 by using gas circulation heat sinks in the barrel to dissipate the heat generated by the powerful
  blaster bolts. These pistols also have a unique energy management system designed to squeeze as much energy out of
  Tibanna gas as possible. While this makes the PB08 more reliable, it also reduces the weapon's range and raw damage
  output.
