  SHOCK BOOTS

  Though shock gloves are fairly common among criminals and law enforcement personnel alike, shock boots are a specialty
  item crafted for those who are determined not to be caught defenseless under any circumstances. A solid kick from
  these boots activates the miniature power generators and electrical circuitry in their soles, delivering a paralyzing
  shock to an opponent. Generally indistinguishable from normal boots, few notice shock boots' dangerous capabilities
  until it's too late.

  Shock boots are worn on the feet, and thus do not require a hand to wield. Add <setback></setback> to a character's
  Perception checks to notice that shock boots are a weapon rather than merely normal footwear.
