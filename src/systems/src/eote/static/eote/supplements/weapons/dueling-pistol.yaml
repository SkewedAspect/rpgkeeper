name: Dueling Pistol
description: Crafted by Coronet Arms, a small weapons manufacturer known for producing high-quality blasters, these
  dueling pistols are almost invariably sold in pairs. Though illegal, dueling has a long history on Corellia, where
  honor often trumps law. Dueling pistols are virtually useless at any great range, the cohesion of their particle
  streams quickly dissipating, but these deadly accurate blasters are meant to be used at close range. Since a single
  shot is all that is permitted in a duel, the power packs only power one blast, but that shot will almost invariably be
  lethal.
