name: Semblan Obsidian Dagger
description: >-
  Like many items made by the Vurk, Semblan daggers tend to serve at least two functions. First, they are utilitarian
  knives, used as both tools and weapons. Second, the blade's iconic design has served as a meditation aid for centuries
  of Vurk sages.

  In their most iconic examples, the dagger's blade curves back and forth as it tapers to a point. Vurk sages hold that
  these gentle undulations mirror the duality of their homeworld. The curving edges hearken to the planet's shallow
  seas, while obsidian inlays evoke the planet's volcanoes. For centuries, they would mediate on this contrast,
  searching for harmony. Even if other species lack that cultural context, studying the dagger still has uses.

  When a Vurk makes a Discipline check at the end of an encounter to heal strain, they heal one additional strain as
  long as they are holding a Semblan dagger. At the GM's discretion, non-Vurk characters can also benefit from this if
  they have a thorough grounding in Vurk culture and the mentality to appreciate the meditative properties.
