name: Baradium Charge
description: >-
  Baradium is one of the most dangerous and volatile explosives used in demolitions. The synthetic mineral is best known
  for being used in thermal detonators. However, baradium can be detonated independently, although these devices are
  inevitably highly volatile. A large enough baradium charge can level a small town, and incorrectly constructing one
  can prove to be the brief and fiery end to a demolitionist's career.

  Baradium weapons deal damage on planetary scale, but their blast radius is measured in personal scale. If the
  demolitionist generates <despair></despair> when setting up the device, it detonates immediately, dealing the device's
  damage (base plus additional damage) to everything in the current blast radius. Anything engaged with the device when
  it detonates should add +50 to any subsequent critical injury or critical hit rolls.
