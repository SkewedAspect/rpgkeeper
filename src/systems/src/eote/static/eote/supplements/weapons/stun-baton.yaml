name: Stun Baton
description: Resembling a typical police truncheon, the Z2 by Merr-Sonn packs an extra, often completely unexpected
  punch in the form of a concentrated stun blast. Carried by riot police and criminal enforcers alike on countless
  planets, the Z2 is a one-handed blunt weapon built from heavily reinforced polymers with conductive alloy striking
  surfaces. When used against organic beings, the Z2 releases a burst of stun energy that can quickly and effectively
  reduce a malcontent to unconsciousness. While not commonly used by the Empire, who prefer a more direct and punitive
  form of policing, stun batons are common in the Outer Rim where law enforcement officers prefer non-lethal methods of
  dealing with the people they serve and protect.
