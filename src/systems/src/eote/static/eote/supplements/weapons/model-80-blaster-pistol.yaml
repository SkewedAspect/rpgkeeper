name: Model 80 Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  The Model 80 from Merr-Sonn Munitions is a rugged and dependable blaster pistol that many mercenaries tend to use as
  their primary weapon. It lacks the stopping power of a heavy blaster pistol, but still fires powerful energy bolts
  that can do a great deal of damage to their target. The weapon gains this stopping power at the expense of weight and
  portability. A bulky blaster, the Model 80 is a bit too heavy for a soldier to carry as a backup weapon and the
  various protuberances and the secondary scope makes it hard to draw quickly in a firefight.

  The time taken to draw, holster, stow, or otherwise access this weapon cannot be reduced by talents, gear, or any
  other means.
