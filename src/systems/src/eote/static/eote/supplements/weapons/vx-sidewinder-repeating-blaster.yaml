name: VX "Sidewinder" Repeating Blaster
description: Unlike other repeating blasters, the SoroSuub VX achieves its high rate of fire through the use of five
  rotating barrels. Each barrel features its own actuating blaster module, galven coil, and crystal housing,
  distributing wear and preventing excessive buildup of heat on any one barrel. Though designed for use with its
  included bipod (see page 188 of the **Edge of the Empire** Core Rules), a wielder with sufficient strength can carry
  and even fire the weapon on the move, albeit invariably with reduced accuracy. Users who intend to wield the VX in
  this way often attach a shoulder strap, although even then the weapon requires two hands to wield.
