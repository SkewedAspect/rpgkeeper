name: Gungan Atlatl
description: >-
  A Gungan warrior could throw one of her signature plasma balls like a grenade (and often do), but a Gungan atlatl
  gives the weapon a greater range and aids in accuracy. The atlatl also protects the wielder from inadvertent
  discharges. These weapons are traditionally carved from nonconductive hardwoods.

  Atlatls throw Gungan plasma balls **(see Table 3-1: Ranged Weapons)**, giving them greater range. An atlatl must have
  a supply of plasma balls for ammunition.
