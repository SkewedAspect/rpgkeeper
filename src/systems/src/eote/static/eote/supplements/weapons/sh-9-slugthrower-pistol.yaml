  Special forces troops understand that sometimes

  high-tech isn’t the best tech to get the jo b done. The

  designers at Czerka Arm s realize this, too, and produce a line of slugthrowers to fill a variety of niche

  roles, such as the SH-9 slugthrower pistol. Covert ops

  units favor this model, dubbed the "whisper pistol,"

  as a stealthy hold-out for silent, up-close takedowns.

  The SH-9 is a compact slugthrower made from composite materials, making it easily hidden from view

  and difficult to detect on weapons scans, even by a

  skilled sensor technician. Its ammo is magazine-fed

  with a small capacity, and the pistol comes with an

  inbuilt silencer to help its user keep a low profile during commando raids and other stealth action. Unlike

  some blasters and even othe r slugthrowers, the SH-9

  functions well enough even when wet or submerged.

  For all these reasons, and the fact that its slugs can

  penetrate most light laminate armors, the SH-9 is a

  favorite boot gun among Alliance SpecOps soldiers.

  Add <setback></setback> to Perception checks to find an SH-9 slugthrower pistol on a person's body. Add
  <setback></setback> to Perception or Vigiliance checks made to locate a concealed shooter firing an SH-9 slugthrower
  pistol.
