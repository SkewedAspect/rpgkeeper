  Makers of the venerable G2-GE beamdrill, Karflo Corporation is a Corporate Sector-based conglomerate with interests in
  industrial mining, droid production, and planetary exploration. Their G-series beamdrills are used throughout the
  galaxy in industries as widely varied as computer production and deep-space asteroid mining. They use
  variable-strength continuous-beam plasma projectors to burn through earth, stone, metals, and nearly any organic or
  inorganic substance in their path. They can perform any kind of cutting or burning task, from gently melting
  lightweight polymers to vaporizing waste materials and industrial byproducts. Recently, Karflo Corporation has been
  exploring smaller, more portable versions of their powerful beamdrills for use by planetary explorers and
  archaeologists. Their first attempt at this market is the G9-GP Pulse Drill.

  The G9-GP is a handheld, low-powered, precision beamdrill designed for work in excavation and light duty mining. They
  appear as long, bulky rods with a tank at one end and a variable-angle plasma cutter at the other. The beam emitted by
  the G9-GP is a rapidly pulsing plasma beam around a millimeter thick with an adjustable range that allows it to cut
  through relatively thick material. While they are primarily tools, their plasma beams make excellent improvised
  weapons in an emergency, and more than a few explorers have had their lives or limbs saved from a surprise attack by
  quick application of the pulse drill.
