name: MR-90 Proton Rifle
description: >-
  Proton rifles are heavy, powerful, long-range weapons originalIy designed for big-game hunting. Unlike a typical
  blaster rifle, which uses volatile Tibanna gas and XCiter technology to produce searing plasma blasts, proton rifles
  use tiny, baradium-fed particle accelerators to create densely charged particle beams. When they strike a target,
  proton rifles' beams deliver a powerful kinetic blast that knocks lighter targets off their feet and can stagger even
  the toughest, meanest prey.

  Merr-Sonn's MR-90 is one of the best proton rifles on the market. Marketed toward wealthy, image-conscious big-game
  hunters, these handsome rifles are equipped with numerous shooting aids to improve their overall performance. They
  feature an integrated gyroscopic balancing system that assists in balance and handling, a multi-optic telescopic sighl
  that allows a shooter to target prey in nearly all conditions, and a charge setting that trades the weapon's
  ammunition capacity for a single, devastating blast. Despite the fact that the MR-90 is marketed as an upscale hunting
  rifle for aristocratic adventurers, many military and paramilitary forces throughout the galaxy have adopted it as a
  dedicated anti-materiel weapon and high-powered sniper rifle.

  As a maneuver, a character using an MR-90 can set the weapon to its charge setting, which allows the shooter to expend
  all of the rifle's energy in a single, devastating blast. Once charged, the MR-90 counts as having the Breach 1 and
  Concussive 2 item qualities. After the charged beam is fired, the weapon runs out of ammunition.
