name: Firecracker Mine
description: >-
  Deployed in groups, firecracker mines emit intense bursts of light, noise, and radiation when they explode. This
  suppresses sensors and comms of any ship within range, making these mines excellent for offensive and defensive
  purposes.

  When a vessel is struck by a firecracker mine each of its crew and occupants suffers the disoriented condition (see
  page 218 of the **Edge of the Empire** Core Rulebook) for 3 rounds.
