name: Model 4 "Thunderhead" Scattergun
description: >-
  The Model 4 Thunderhead by Czerka is a relatively new entry into the galactic arms market. Designed as a competitor to
  Adostic Arms' 8-gauge "AA8" scattergun, the Thunderhead is the latest word in close-quarters combat weaponry. Based on
  an ancient and simple slug-throwing technology, the Thunderhead is a rifle-sized, semi-automatic, smoothbore weapon
  that fires clouds of small ferroalloy pellets instead of bolts, slugs, or other traditional projectiles. When used in
  enclosed spaces, such as ship compartments, building corridors, and the like, these weapons are extremely effective
  against both unarmored and lightly armored targets.

  Unlike the AA8, which relies on a large-bore shell with a large number of inert pellets, the Model 4 uses a smaller
  shell that is packed with tiny explosive pellets. This makes for a smaller, easier-to-handle weapon than the M8, with
  a lighter recoil and increased ammunition capacity. It also gives the weapon the ability to crack open light armor and
  vehicles and take down powerful beasts like gundarks and rancors. Czerka also sells a variety of different ammo types
  for the Thunderhead-everything from flechette rounds to inert shot to non-lethal gel rounds-providing users with a
  great amount of versatility on the battlefield.
