name: Detonite Charge
description: Detonite is a powerful explosive used for demolitions work—and for sabotage. A detonite charge is not a
  weapon per se, and is not intended for use in combat situations. However, detonite charges are often used to set
  traps, and some sentients mine the site of an expected confrontation to gain the advantage. Detonite requires a
  trigger mechanism to set off, and each charge comes with a simple trigger that can be detonated via comlink or timer
  (times can be from one hour to one second).
