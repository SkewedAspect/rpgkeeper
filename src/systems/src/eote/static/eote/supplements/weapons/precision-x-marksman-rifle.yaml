description: >-
  Cadregg Armory is a newcomer to the arms manufacturing scene, but its initial offerings have been impressive enough to
  keep many eyes on what they produce next. One of the first weapons the company produced was the "Precision-X" series,
  now highly coveted weapons sought by everyone from sport shooters to assassins. The company can hardly maintain a
  stock of these specialized rifles, so high is the demand for their unique capabilities.

  The Precision-X blasters use a series of multiple cycling chambers to excite the blaster gas used so that it produces
  extraordinarily intense beams. The blasters' shots are only somewhat more powerful than those of typical carbines, but
  the blasts maintain an extraordinary coherence over long ranges, allowing them to punch through light armor and
  maintain full stopping power well past the limitations of a typical rifle. The effects of these cycling chambers even
  extend to the blaster's stun setting, making it ideal for bounty hunters trying to bring in a target alive.

  When this weapon's stun setting is used to deal stun damage, its range changes to medium instead of short (and cannot
  be increased).
