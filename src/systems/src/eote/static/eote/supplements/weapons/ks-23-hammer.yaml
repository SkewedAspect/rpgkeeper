name: KS-23 Hammer
description: >-
  The KS-23 is yet another popular slugthrowing design by Czerka Arms. A rarity even among the already scarce
  slugthrowing class of weapons, the KS-23 fires a canister of small explosive pellets instead of a single long-range,
  precision slug. When fired, these pellets scatter from the barrel to fill a wide area with as much destructive
  potential as possible. Brutally effective at short and medium ranges, this weapon is known unofficially as the
  "Hammer."

  The KS-23 was initially produced as a hunting weapon to take down extremely hardy beasts like the krayt dragon or
  rancor. They are roughly the size of a blaster carbine, with a large-caliber smoothbore barrel, a sturdy action, and
  composite stocks and furniture. The ammunition is stored in a tubular, five-round magazine that runs under the barrel,
  and the firing mechanism is self-loading and uses the weapon's recoil for power. An extremely unsubtle weapon, the
  KS-23 is loud and has a powerful recoil thanks to the large-bore, high-powered ammunition it fires.

  Thanks to its rugged construction and powerful ammunition, the KS-23 has gained a wide following in the Outer Rim.
  Easy to maintain and repair and built from high-quality, resilient materials, the Hammer stands up exceedingly well to
  the kinds of abuse equipment suffers in the wild places of the galaxy. Used primarily by big-game hunters, these
  weapons have also found their way into the armories of explorers, smugglers, pirates, and even some planetary
  law-enforcement agencies who appreciate their power and utility.
