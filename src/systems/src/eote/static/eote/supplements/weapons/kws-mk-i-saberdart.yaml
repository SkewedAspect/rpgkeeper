  Kaminoan Weaponsmiths, a subsidiary of Kaminoan Armorsmiths Ltd., is a small weapons producer based on the watery
  planet of Kamino. Its products are all essentially handmade, produced in msall numbers byu highly trained craftsmen
  and sold in limited runs. The company is relatively unknown outside of certain circles—namely bounty hunters and
  professional killers—but among its select cliente. it has a reputation for well-made, high-quality products.

  Perhaps their most popular product is the Mk. I Saberdart. The Saberdart, a name that applies to both the dart itself
  and its launcher, is a tiny, roughly triangualr durasteel alloy dart fired via compressed air. The dart has three
  hooked barbs surrouding a central cylinder tipped withy an incredibly sharp needle. Within the central core of the
  dart is a small, fillable chamber used to deliver toxins and poisons to targets at range. Saberdarts can be used to
  deliver anything tranquillizers to deadly neurotoxins such as Fex-M3 and Malkite themfar. They are silent, deadly,
  obscure and largely untraceable, which makes them a perfect weapon for assassins.

  Saberdart launchers have lightweight barrels that propel their darts via compressed gas. Dart launchers can be built
  into gloves, pieces of armor, other weapons, even innocuous pieces of everyday gear like datapads and glowrods.

  Saberdarts may be loaded with 1 dose of synthetic neuroparalytic (see page 181 of the **Force and Destiny** Core
  Rulebook), or any other poison the GM, deems appropriate. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target with the
  weapon (even if she deals no damage), the target also suggers the effects of being exposed to the poison.
