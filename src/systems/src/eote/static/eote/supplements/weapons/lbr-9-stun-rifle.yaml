description: >-
  Stun rifles are rare weapons in the galaxy, perceived by most to be of limited utility. Possessing low-intensity
  blast-actuating modulators and using a lower yield mix of blast gasses than other, more lethal blaster rifles, stun
  rifles are capable of only nonlethal stunning blasts. Most of these weapons are used in law enforcement, corrections,
  and occasionally in bounty hunting, fields in which the need to keep targets alive is often of paramount importance.
  They are typically short ranged, and their bolts have a broad spread to catch as many targets in their blast as
  possible. While this is effective in close quarters or in large crowds, in open terrain their effectiveness is sadly
  reduced. To counter this, and to corner the market in long-range stun blasters, BlasTech recently released the all-new
  LBR-9 Stun Rifle.

  Based on the current model DL-87 Firespray stun rifle, the LBR-9 is a long-barreled, light-framed blaster rifle fitted
  with composite furniture and simple iron sights. Using the majority of the Firespray's firing system with an upgraded
  galven pattern designed to fit the longer barrel, the LBR-9 can fire a concentrated, high-penetration stun bolt with a
  range and accuracy commensurate with other, more lethal weapons in its class. With its optimized and upgraded galven
  pattern and a patented mix of blaster gasses, the LBR-9 packs quite a punch and typically needs only one or two shots
  to knock a target out of commission. Only recently brought to market and largely sold to Core Systems' planetary
  law-enforcement agencies, few of these specialized weapons have found their way to the fringes of civilized space.
  Those that do are quickly snatched up by both beast and bounty hunters for their precise handling characteristics and
  nonlethal nature, and they are gaining a reputation as finely made, accurate, and dependable weapons.
