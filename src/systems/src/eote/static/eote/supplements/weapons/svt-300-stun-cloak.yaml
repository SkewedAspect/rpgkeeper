  Koromondain SVT-300 Stun Cloak

  At first glance, the Koromondain SVT-300 stun cloak appears to be nothing more than a typical thermal cloak with a
  handsome metallic sheen. This sheen is produced by a series of special fibers that conduct a focused electrical charge
  across the cloak’s surface. Once the cloak has been activated by depressing a stud in its clasp, anyone who comes into
  contact with its exterior suffers an intense electrical discharge.

  Though designed as a defensive weapon, the stun cloak can also be used offensively while grappling an opponent.

  If the wielder of the stun cloak is hit by a melee or brawl attack, the attacker suffers 7 damage. This damage is
  applied to the target’s strain threshold. This effect consumes one of the cloak’s payload of charges from its Limited
  Ammo quality.

  Once the cloak has expended its payload of three charges, the power source in its clasp must recharge for three
  minutes before it can be used again.
