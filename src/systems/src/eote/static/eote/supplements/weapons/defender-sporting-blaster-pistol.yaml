name: Defender Sporting Blaster Pistol
description: Producing a number of high-quality blaster weapons, the Drearian Defense Conglomerate is especially known
  for supplying the Corporate Sector Authority. However, several of their models have achieved popularity among the
  aristocracy and nobility. The DDC Defender pistol is typically used in honor duels and hunting, but it offers a number
  of distinct advantages for other uses. Its small size and simple disassembly method make it easily concealable, and
  the weapon also boasts automatic minor-malfunction repair and an unusually large number of shots per charge. While not
  the strongest of weapons, those who master it for hunting and dueling find their skills transfer well to more deadly
  contexts.
