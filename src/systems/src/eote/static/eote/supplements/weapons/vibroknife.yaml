name: Vibroknife
description: >-
  A vibroknife is essentially a modded combat knife, but since they have proven so effective, they have become
  manufactured as such throughout the galaxy. The basic premise is simple—a small but powerful device within the knife's
  handle vibrates the blade at an incredibly high frequency so that it essentially acts as a miniature saw. Vibroknives
  aren't as powerful as lightsabers against most substances, but one need not be a Jedi to wield it effectively.

  **Models Include**: Merr-Sonn Treppus-2 Vibroblade.
