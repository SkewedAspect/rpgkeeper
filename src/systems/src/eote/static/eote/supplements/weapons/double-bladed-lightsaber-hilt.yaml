description: >-
  The soul of each lightsaber is its crystal. The Jedi of old tested their younglings by sending them to search for
  their lightsaber crystals. The process was as much a spiritual journey as a physical search, with the trainees
  confronting their inner demons as part of the process. In finding a crystal, they bonded with it in a way that
  transcended the physical realm.

  The hilt of the lightsaber, on the other hand, is a primarily mechanical system. Individuals can customize a hilt,
  adding ornamentation or additional functionality just as they can with any weapon or item. In this way, an individual
  can make a unique hilt that is truly his, but it is still simply an item.

  Provided here are the hilts for the lightsabers listed in this chapter. Each requires a crystal to become a true
  weapon (otherwise they deal no damage, have no critical rating, and do not have many of their item qualities).
  However, a PC wanting to construct their own lightsabers should start with a hilt. If the PC wants to construct his
  own hilt out of available materials, the GM can still have him make a check to find the hilt, based on its rarity, and
  pay the cost. This represents the PC finding and paying for the raw materials. Then it is simply a matter of spending
  a few hours putting the materials together to build the hilt—no checks are necessary.
