name: Site-145 Replica Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  Though the Jedi Order was primarily known for its use of lightsabers, there have been countless other Force traditions
  throughout the galaxy's long and murky history, and many fought with other weapons. One such ancient culture used
  blasters with Force-attuned triggers, and examples of these weapons have been found in archaeological sites across the
  galaxy. The best preserved relics were non-functional when discovered at so-called "Site-145" on the third moon of
  Filata, but not all members of the expedition were content to study this history purely in the abstract. Sokiro
  Terebin, an artificer and antiquarian of the Jedi Order who lived just prior to the Clone Wars, constructed a number
  of replicas as museum pieces, and her notes and blueprints were recorded in various archives. Though fully functional
  as weapons (in the hands of Force-sensitives, anyway), these armaments were largely viewed as historical curiosities
  during the days of the Republic and were rarely (if ever) used. Since the rise of the Empire, these pieces (and the
  blueprints to build them) have disappeared onto the black market, where the command a reasonably high price as
  contraband items related to the Jedi.

  The Site-145 replica blaster pistol automatically features the Force-attuned resonater weapon attachment (see page 54
  of Keeping the Peace).
