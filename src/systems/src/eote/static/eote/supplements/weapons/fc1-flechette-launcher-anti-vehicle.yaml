name: FC1 Flechette Launcher (Anti-Vehicle)
description: >-
  The FC1 is representative of most shoulder-braced flechette launchers. This bulky, box-shaped launcher holds four
  canister tubes, and can fire either anti-personnel or anti-vehicle flechettes. The weapon fires small missiles
  designed to detonate close to their target, then shred it with numerous durasteel darts. The standard anti-infantry
  canister releases hundreds of small flechettes over a wide area, ideal for taking down groups of enemies. Anti-vehicle
  rounds feature a much smaller number, usually fewer than a dozen, of significantly larger and heavier darts capable of
  shearing straight through ten centimeters of durasteel plating. The shaped charge of an anti-vehicle cartridge focuses
  the projectiles over a much smaller area, and is ideal for bringing down repulsorcraft or other light vehicles
  (especially since the armor-penetrating darts tend to slice through the thick outer armor then bounce around inside
  the hull, tearing up vital components).

  Before firing the FC1, the firer must use the scope's built-in range finder to program a detonation range
  approximately 10 meters in front of the target for ideal dispersal of flechettes. This guarantees he hits the target
  with the blast. The anti-vehicle rounds of a flechette launcher have a much narrower spread, making them highly
  inaccurate against small targets. When used against targets of silhouette 1 or smaller and firing anti-vehicle rounds,
  the weapon gains the Inaccurate 3 quality.

  An FC1 may be loaded with anti-personnel or anti-vehicle rounds, and can fire a total of four shots. Some mercenaries
  tend to load the FC1 with a mix of both, so that they can respond to any situation. In this case, the character should
  note what his weapon is loaded with, and use the appropriate profile with each shot. He still has to track total shots
  as per the Limited Ammo quality.
