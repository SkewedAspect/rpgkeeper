  Mer-Sonn Model 14 "Stalker" Vibrospear

  The Stalker is Merr-Sonn Munitions' answer to LaserHone's surprisingly popular Huntsman Vibrospear. Like its
  competitor, the Stalker is a long, sturdy vibrospear nearly as tall as a grown Wookiee, and is designed for hunting
  large, particularly dangerous wild game. It has a strong, flexible reinforced plasteel haft over two meters long,
  capped bt a leaf-shaped blade capable of piercing the toughest hide or thickest armor. Beneath the blade are two short
  barbs that extend for a few centimeters perpendicular from the haft. These barbs are desinged to stop wounded
  creatures from charging up the weapons haft after they are stabbed, and this attacking the user while in their death
  throes.

  While it is lighter and decidedly cheaper than LaserHone's weaponm the Stalker suffers from a few drawbacks. In an
  effort to keep weight and cost down, Merr-Sonn used the standard model vibrofield generator found in all of their
  vibro weapons and equipped the Stalker with only the simplest noise-reduction system. This means that while the
  vibrofield generator's sound output is greatly reduced it makes enough noise to alert most creatures to the user's
  presence, which makes hunting with the weapon a challenge. Despite this, the Stalker's popularlity continues to grow
  and it is seen as an affordable alternative to its heavier more expensive competition.

  The Stalker vibrospear requires two hands to use. The GM may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> from any combat
  check with this weapon to have it produce a loud noise, spooking nearby animals, alerting foes and adding
  <setback></setback><setback></setback> to the user's next Survival check in this area to hunt or track prey.
