name: Repulsor Gun
description: >-
  Bored Technicians sometimes take a repulsor engine, add a charge capacitor and simple trigger mechinism and use it to
  amuse themselves during  lean periods.  Most often used to knock over empty caf containers, the repulsor gun still
  packs a mean punch.

  On a <despair></despair> result, the repulsor gun backfires; the user is knocked prone and suffers the disoriented
  condition for 2 rounds.
