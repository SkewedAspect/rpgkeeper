name: Basic Lightsaber
description: >-
  The basic lightsaber is, in essence, the baseline to which all other lightsabers and their variants are compared. It
  consists of a basic hilt constructed from whatever material was available to the builder, typically metal or
  composites. Simple weapons, though still exceedingly elegant, all lightsabers are equipped with some form of kyber
  crystal. Kyber crystals are actually a broad family of different types of crystals. Though these can vary in shape and
  coloration, and even certain properties, kyber crystals share certain unique attributes. These attributes allow kyber
  crystals to be used within lightsabers, enabling them to focus the lightsabers' power into their signature energy
  blades. Prior to the rise of the Empire, nearly every lightsaber constructed by the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars
  contained a crystal gathered by a Padawan on the planet Ilum as part of the journey to become a Jedi Knight. These
  Ilum specimens are some of the best examples of kyber crystals.

  This lightsaber is a basic lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Ilum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal
  occupies two of the weapon's hard points.

  **Models Include:** None; each of these weapons is individually constructed.
