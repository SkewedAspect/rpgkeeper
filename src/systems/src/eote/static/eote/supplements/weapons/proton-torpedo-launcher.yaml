name: Proton Torpedo Launcher
description: >-
  Proton torpedoes are highly advanced anti-ship projectiles typically carried by starfighters and patrol boats. They
  are larger and bulkier than concussion missiles and have a squat, conical warhead, meaning their launchers carry fewer
  rounds than an equivalent concussion missile launcher. These weapons mount a deadly, irradiating, proton-scattering
  warhead detonated by a volatile Nergon-14 explosive charge. Proton torpedoes are designed to damage and destroy large
  vessels like bulk transports and capital ships. They allow small ships like starfighters and patrol boats to punch
  well above their weight.

  Additional proton torpedoes cost 750 credits each and are Restricted.
