name: Ashla Staff
description: >-
  Like the Bo-Rifle, Ashla Staffs were one of the many items plundered by the Empire during the Fall of Lasan. Unlike
  the rifles, though, these were not weapons of war. Staffs such as these were the unique property of a Revered
  Master-mystical leaders of the Lasat people. Like the Jedi, these sages studied and communed with the Force, though
  they referred to it as the Ashla.

  Before the Fall of Lasan, many were quick to equate the Ashla Staff to a Jedi's lightsaber. This would not, by and
  large, be an accurate comparison. An Ashla Staff's construction might reflect on its owner in a similar way, but that
  would be the full extent of similarities. The staff might be tall and spry, or gnarled and bent. A Revered Master
  might fashion it from a single branch, once gifted to them by a Tholothian dignitary. What united these tools was
  their connection to Lasat mysticism. Among other qualities, they gave strength to Revered Masters during particularly
  grueling rituals.

  These vibrant cultural expressions have become rare under the Empire. The Revered Masters who survived the Fall of
  Lasan have since passed on or disappeared. Some bequeathed their staffs to their descendants. Others sold them while
  fleeing the Empire. Many who own these implements now know little of their original purpose. All they know is that a
  mysterious power seems to flow through them. There is a flicker of destiny in everything the staff touches.

  While wielding an Ashla Staff and making a Force power check, a player may spend 3 strain to add [LI] to the results.
