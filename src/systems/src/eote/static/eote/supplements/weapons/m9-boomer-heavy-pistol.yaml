  Czerka M9 "Boomer" Heavy Pistol

  Known colloquially as the "hand cannon," Czerka's Cz M9 "Boomer" is a standout in the heavy pistol market. Designed to
  cram as much killing power in as small a package as possible, the Boomer is a thick, squat, large-caliber slugthrowing
  pistol. Instead of standard metal slugs, however, the Boomer fires small, fin-stabilized grenades from a detachable
  box magazine. The Boomer's grenades give the shooter respectable anti-personnel capabilities. The downside to all this
  firepower is a limited payload and a weapon that is often inaccurate and difficult to use.

  During combat, GMs may make this weapon run out of ammunition by spending
