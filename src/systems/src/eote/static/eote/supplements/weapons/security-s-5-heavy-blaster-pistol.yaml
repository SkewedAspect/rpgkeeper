name: Security S-5 Heavy Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  A pistol designed and manufactured by Theed Arms on Naboo, the Security S-5 is a reliable, versatile weapon. During
  the Clone Wars, it was a preferred weapon of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, and it remains a popular choice for
  private security groups, bodyguards and other blaster conoisseurs. Its under-barrel dart launcher can be configured to
  launch solid projectiles of various sorts; on eparticularly common choice is a grappling hook attached to a cable,
  which wielders can use to anchor themselves to nearby objects, swing across gaps, and safely descend into drops.

  As an action, a character may make an Average (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Ranged (Light)
  check to secure the grappling hook to an object within medium range. On success, as an action, he may reel in the
  cord, pullin ghimself to the object (or, if the object is unsecured and lighter than he is, pulling it to him). A
  character may use the grappling hook to pull another character aloft with him; if he does, he must make an Average
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Athletics check to avoid losing his grip on either his partner or
  his gun.
