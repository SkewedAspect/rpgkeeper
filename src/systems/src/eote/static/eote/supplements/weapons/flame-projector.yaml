name: Flame Projector
description: >-
  Flame-producing devices are primarily used to destroy material such as structures or crops, rather than as
  anti-personnel weapons. Of course, they excel at scorching flesh and bone as well.

  Flame projectors are popular partially because of their wide and indiscriminate cone of fire, able to catch several
  individuals in a gout of flame. When triggering the weapon's Burn quality, the user may choose to apply it to any one
  target hit by the attack; this quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.
  However, the GM can spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> to apply the weapon's Burn quality
  to an ally hit by the original attack.

  **Models Include**: Merr-Sonn C-22 Flame Carbine, Merr-Sonn CR-24 Flame Rifle.
