name: Rivet Gun
description: >-
  Most rivet guns work around the principle of a basic pneumatic hammer, and fire bolts into vehicle plating. Of course,
  some rivet guns are more-potent than others, based on the thickness of the plating they are intended to secure. As
  such, a Technician can easily adapt a more powerful rivet gunt into a serviceable slugthrower by ignoring a few of the
  safety operating protocols, such as "keep cartridge pressure at or beneath printed factory settings" and never point
  the rivet gun at living creatures or droids". While rivet guns are hardly combat weapons, and thus only function up
  close and with minimal accuracy, no wise sentient would completely ignore the threat presented by an irate Technician
  carrying one.

  A rivet gun reduces the difficulty of Mechanics checks to reapair Critical Hits on vehicles and starships by 1 (to a
  minimum of **Simple (-)**).
