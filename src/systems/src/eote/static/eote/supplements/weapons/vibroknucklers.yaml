name: Vibroknucklers
description: >-
  For those who like to let their fists do the talking, a set of vibroknucklers can ensure the last word. Worn like the
  more common brass knuckles, a small blade running the length of the wearer's knuckles vibrates at an ultrasonic rate
  when the user clenches his fist. Without changing his fighting style, a brawler equipped with vibroknucklers can
  easily inflict horrific and fatal wounds with simple punches.

  Add <setback></setback> to attempts to locate vibroknucklers concealed about an individual's body. Vibroknucklers
  cannot deal damage to a target's strain threshold.
