  BlasTech M-300 Hunting Blaster

  The M-300 is one of BlasTech's most popular civilian blaster rifles. Nicknamed the "Hunting Blaster", this weapon is
  designed to meet the needs of serious hunters and others who make their livings in the wilderness. Built to withstand
  the rigors the rigors of backcountry life, the M-300 is lightweight and rugged. It has a reinforced, weather-sealed,
  polycarbonate frame that easily stands up to heavy impacts, extremes of heat and cold, and hazardous environments with
  little effect on performance. A specially designed precison barrel provides the M-300 with unparalleled accuracy and
  range for a weapon of its class. In addition, the M-300's galven circuitry and gas XCiter system produce a more
  intense, coherent blaster beam, which gives the weapon enough punch to drop even the toughest beast. The M-300 also
  comes equipped with a sling and integral, non-removabble telescopic optical sight to enhance its performance and ease
  of use.
