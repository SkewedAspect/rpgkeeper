id: eote-weapon-long-bow
name: Long Bow
description: Much less technically sophisticated than a blaster, a longbow remains a deadly weapon in properly trained
  hands. The quiet twang of a bowstring also does not carry nearly as far as the firing sounds of a blaster or
  slugthrower. In a primitive environment, characters separated from technological resources can fashion arrows from
  natural materials far more easily than they can develop a charging system for an energy weapon.
