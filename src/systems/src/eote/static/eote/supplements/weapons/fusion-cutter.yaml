name: Fusion Cutter
description: >-
  These handheld, portable cutting torches are found throughout the galaxy in numerous induStrial, technical, and even
  artistic operations. They use small, high-powered fusion batteries to produce intense plasma or laser beams used to
  weld metals together and to cut them apart, depending on the needs of the user. Their beams can easily cut through
  durasteel, duraplast, and even armored ship hulls with ease. Field mechanics often carry them into battle for
  emergency repairs of vehicles, droids, and other equipment. Fusion cutters can be adjusted to produce a fine, precise
  beam for welds or a broad, powerful beam good for brazing and cutting. Engineering and mechanic droids can have a
  fusion cutter directly installed in their chassis so that they always have one at hand, and they are especially common
  on astromech druids. In a pinch, a fusion cutter can be used as a close-quarters weapon, and can cause some incredibly
  frightful wounds. If used as a weapon, a fusion cutter has a range of engaged, deals 5 damage, has a critical rating
  of 3, and possesses the Breach 1, Burn 3, Sunder, and Vicious 3 weapon qualities.
