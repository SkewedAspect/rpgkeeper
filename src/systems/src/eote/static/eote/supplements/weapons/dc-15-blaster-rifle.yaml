name: DC-15 Blaster Rifle
description: >-
  The DC-15 was, before the introduction of the DC-15A carbine, the standard issue longarm of the GAR. Roughly as long
  as a clone is tall, these weapons are heavy, poorly balanced, and extremely difficult to use anywhere but in a wide
  open battlefield. They tend to suffer beam cohesion issues after sustained fire, which negatively affects their short-
  to medium-range accuracy and they are generally unpleasant weapons to deal with on a daily basis.

  Despite these glaring flaws, the DC-15 remains surprisingly popular among the clone ranks for one simple reason: raw
  power. The DC-15 is one of the most powerful heavy blaster rifles in current use. It can punch through laminate armor
  at 1,000 meters, and at closer ranges it can destroy lightly armored vehicles. It rarely overheats or needs to be
  reloaded, is extremely reliable, and can be serviced with the bare minimum of tools In the field. Many clone marksmen
  have adopted it as their primary weapon, fitting it with long-range optical systems and gyrostabilization units to
  increase combat effectiveness.
