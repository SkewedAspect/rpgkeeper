description: >-
  The Huntsman by LaserHone, a maker of fine vibroweapons based in the Corporate Sector, is a relative oddity among
  weapons of its class. Over two meters long, the Huntsman is a sturdy vibrospear designed for hunting large and
  dangerous wild game. Equipped with LaserHone's patented ultrasonic vibrotechnology, the vibrogenerator in the Huntsman
  vibrates at frequencies well outside the hearing range of most sentients. The ultrasonic vibrogenerator, special
  dampening fittings, and a coating of sound-absorbing polymers make the Huntsman completely silent when active. This
  allows a hunter to carry a powerful vibroweapon in the field without the fear of spooking his prey with the noise from
  the weapon.

  The Huntsman's haft is a super-dense plasteel alloy embedded with sound-deadening materials and laced with foil-fiber
  reinforcements. Incredibly strong and flexible, the Huntsman can parry nearly any incoming blow, from the claws of a
  powerful beast to the slashing edge of a vibro-ax. The blade is a long, thin, leaf-shaped affair made from a
  laser-honed steel alloy with a molecular edge that can pass through steel and stone as easy as through flesh and
  muscle. At the base of the blade where it meets the haft, two thick posts extend for a few centimeters perpendicular
  to the haft to prevent particularly recalcitrant beasts from charging up the haft after being stabbed and attacking
  the spear's wielder. While it is more of a niche weapon with limited appeal, many professional scouts and hunters
  appreciate the deadly simplicity of the Huntsman and the challenge of hunting untamed beasts in ways similar to their
  ancient forebears.

  The vibrospear requires two hands to wield.
