  SoroSuub "Renegade" Heavy Blaster Pistol

  The Renegade is the most powerful blaster pistol ever manufactured by SoroSuub. Popular with pirates and smugglers,
  the weapon is large and intimidating without being cumbersome and unwieldy. Due to its reliability, it’s also favored
  by Rebel SpecOps troops and vehicle crews. Though the weapon’s range is comparable to that of a typical heavy blaster
  pistol, the sacrifices made to increase its damage cause it to be somewhat inaccurate.
