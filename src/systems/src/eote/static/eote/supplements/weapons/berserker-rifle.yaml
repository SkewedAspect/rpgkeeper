name: Berserker Rifle
description: >-
  The berserker rifle was originally a custom weapon commonly used by bounty hunters in the Outer Rim and Unknown
  Regions. It gets its name from a misunderstood colloquial mish-mash of terms refering to bothe the lightning-jacks and
  blind  berserkers of the Stratos Distribution. Hundreds of years after its inception, a handful of weapons developers
  like Arakyd Industriesz Zoltan Arms, and even Imperial Munitions manufacture a variety of models.

  At its core, the berserker rifle operates like a scaled-down version of the Wookiee bowcaster, using magnetic
  accelerator to stabilize and fire charged micro-slugs at incredible velocities. The weapon differs from the bowcaster
  by electrifying the slugs rather than encasing them in ionic particles, which has the potential to electrocute the
  ttarget, wracking them convulsions and possibly even igniting flammable articles of clothing or equipment.
