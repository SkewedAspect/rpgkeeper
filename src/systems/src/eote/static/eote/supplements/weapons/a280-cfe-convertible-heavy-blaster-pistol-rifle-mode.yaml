name: A280-CFE Convertible Heavy Blaster Pistol (Rifle Mode)
description: >-
  The A280-CFE by BlasTech was designed during the Clone Wars for Galactic Republic intelligence agents. Based on the
  venerable A280, the CFE is sold as a heavy blaster pistol, albeit one with a few new tricks up its sleeve. A user can
  attach a number of accessories—a shoulder stock, longer precision barrel, multi-optic sight, gyrobalancer, etc.—to
  convert the pistol into a very serviceable sniper rifle. The pistol and accessories are sold as a package along with a
  sturdy, lockable reinforced polycarbonate carrying case. The A280's modular nature and versatility make the weapon
  easy to transport and conceal, an extremely attractive feature for agents and infiltrators.

  A character can spend a maneuver to convert the CFE from pistol to rifle mode, or rifle to pistol mode. With the rifle
  accessories attached, the weapon's range becomes long, and it gains the Accurate 1 and Pierce 1 item qualities.
  Characters use the Ranged (Heavy) skill when firing the weapon in rifle mode.
