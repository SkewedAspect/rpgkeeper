  Taim & Bak KB-50A Beam Cannon

  Some Sabers were equipped with beam cannon turrets in place of the standard twin medium laser cannons. Beam cannons
  are specially tuned laser weapons with a high output and long dwell time. They fire continuous beams of energy at a
  target for roughly three seconds, and then require a few seconds to recharge before firing again. These weapons hit
  incredibly hard, can punch through light and medium armor with ease, and have a nasty tendency to set targets on fire.

  Sabers equipped with KB-50a beam cannons are used in heavy support roles, providing cover fire for more lightly armed
  Saber platoons and squads of infantry during advances and assaults.

  A turret-mounted KB-50a Beam Cannon has the following profile: (Fire Arc All; Damage 7; Critical 3: Range (Medium);
  Breach 2, Burn 2, Slow-Firing 2, Vicious 1).
