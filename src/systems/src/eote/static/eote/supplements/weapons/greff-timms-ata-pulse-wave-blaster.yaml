name: Greff-Timms ATA Pulse-Wave Blaster
description: These ancient weapons were state-of-the-art thousands of years ago, prior to the development of the modern
  blaster. Operating on the same basic principle as a blaster, the pulse-wave blaster fires a short beam of intense
  energy at its target. However, this energy tends to dissipate quickly, making its effective range quite short. The
  destabilizing molecular effect produced by these weapons is similar to that of disruptors, resulting in particularly
  vicious wounds. While generally considered archaic, some rogues and criminals still appreciate the pulse-wave
  blaster's unpleasant capacity for mayhem.
