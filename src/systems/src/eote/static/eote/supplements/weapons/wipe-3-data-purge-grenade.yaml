  SoroSuub Wipe-3 Data-Purge Grenade

  Although information is sometimes committed to flimsiplast or other forms of physical storage, most data storage
  utilizes electronic media. Overwhelming physical damage can eliminate memory banks and similar devices, but expert
  slicing can sometimes reconstitute and extract viable data. For more certain methods of data erasure, agents turn to
  devices like SoroSuub Wipe-3 data-purge grenades. These small, one-use devices release a focused pulse that scrambles
  data, usually without destroying hardware.

  Any computer or similar device hit by a data-purge grenade loses all programming, memory, or any other kind of
  electronically stored data, but remains otherwise undamaged. A droid hit by a data-purge grenade must make a **Hard
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Resilience check** or suffer 1 strain,
  plus 1 additional strain per <failure></failure>. At the GM's discretion,
  <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> on the check can cause the droid to lose
  portions of its memory.
