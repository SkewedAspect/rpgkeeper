  BlasTech DL-19C Blaster Pistol

  BlasTech's venerable DL-18 is one of the more common blaster pistols across the galaxy, and has been a considerable
  success for BlasTech for years. The DL-19C is a mcuh more specialised weapon, targeted at a niche market of weapon
  hobbyists, perfectionists and others who want the ability to adjust every aspect of the weapon to their personal
  taste, from the sensitivity of the trigger, to the shape of the barrel, to the energy outflow from the charge pack.
  While these guns are produced in limited number, discerning firearms enthusiasts often recognise each other based on
  possession of this weapon.

  When a character applies the Jury Rigged talent to this weapon, he may select one additional option from the talent's
  list and apply it to the weapon. The character cannot select the same option twice.
