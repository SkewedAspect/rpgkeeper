name: Electromag-Pulse Disruptor
description: >-
  An electromag-pulse disruptor is a device is a slim stylus used to short out electronic equipment. While some
  Technicians who work with droids or computer systems that might run out of control need such a device to anyone who
  ends up in a combat situation. In the Core Worlds, machinists rarely need to concern themselves with such risks, but
  in the Outer Rim, where marauders and pirates about, possession of such a device can mean the difference between life
  and death.
