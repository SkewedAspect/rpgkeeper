name: Punch Dagger
description: >-
  A punch dagger, also known as a push dagger or gimlet knife, is a small, short-bladed knife attached to a T-shaped
  handle, or "gimlet." The user grasps the gimlet so the blade protrudes between his fingers. Easily-concealed, the
  punch dagger allows the user the put considerable force behind a thrust, often piercing thick clothing and simple
  armor. A favorite holdout weapon among gamblers, a punch dagger typically won't set off the weapons detectors used in
  many gambling dens and the backrooms of cantinas throughout the galaxy.
