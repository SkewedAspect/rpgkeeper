name: CZ-28 Flamestrike
description: A direct and blatant copy of the Merr-Sonn CR-28 flame cannon, the CZ-28 Flamestrike heavy weapon is a
  powerful flame projector with an effective range double that of standard flame projectors. This weapon is also about
  twice the size and weight of an ordinary flame projector, and as such is usually vehicle-mounted. However, individuals
  with the strength to wield it find few weapons as deadly and terrifying to their foes as a CZ-28 Flamestrike.
