name: Mini Thermal Detonator
description: >-
  These insidious devices are half the size of frag grenades but have a thermite-baradium casing surrounding a baradium
  core. On detonation, the resulting fusion reaction creates a particle wave that disintegrates everything in the blast.
  One mini-detonator can clear a large room. The stats for them are as follows: (Ranged [Light]; Damage 12; Critical 2;
  Range [Short]; Blast 10). Blast 10 means that the attacker can spend 2 Advantage
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> to ensure the blast hits everyone within short range of the original
  target, dealing 10 damage to each.

  Thermal detonators can be either set to detonate on impact, or be set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after
  being activated at the beginning of the attacker's action.

  This particular batch was defective, so the weapon only detonates if 3 Advantage
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> or a Triumph <triumph></triumph> are spent
  during the **Ranged (Light) check**. On a Despair <despair></despair> it explodes prematurely in the wielder's hand.
