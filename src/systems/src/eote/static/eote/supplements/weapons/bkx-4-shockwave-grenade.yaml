name: BKX-4 "Shockwave" Grenade
description: >-
  The BKX-4 is one of a number of grenades built by Baktoid Personal Ordnance, a subsidiary of Baktoid Armor Workshop.
  Like its closest competitor, the Merr-Sonn G2, the BKX-4 causes damage with overpressure and shockwaves rather than
  shrapnel, baradium, or incendiary chemicals. The broad blast and shockwave caused by a detonating BKX-4 is strong
  enough to kill multiple unarmored targets and can seriously damage structures, machinery, and materiel. These grenades
  are popular with combat engineers, who use them to clear bunkers, sabotage installations, and generally cause immense
  amounts of mayhem and destruction.

  If the user activates this grenade's Disorient or Knockdown qualities, these qualities affect all characters at short
  range from the target (even if they are not damaged by the weapon).
