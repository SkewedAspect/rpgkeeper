name: Shield Gauntlet
description: >-
  Shield gauntlets are specialized defensive items popularized by the Kilian Rangers of Kilia IV. Appearing to be little
  more than a high-tech gauntlet, a shield gauntlet projects a protective, concave energy field of indistinct
  coloration. Though these unique items are used primarily by members of the Kilian Rangers, both as a defensive item
  and as a reminder of their oath to defend themselves and their families, a handful of shield gauntlets have found
  their way into the hands of collectors, black marketeers, and Force sensitives.

  A shield gauntlet counts as a Lightsaber weapon for the purposes of the Reflect talent (see page 150 of the Force and
  Destiny core rulebook).
