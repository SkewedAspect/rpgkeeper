name: VX "Czerhander" Vibro-Greatsword
description: >-
  The Czerka model VX is similar to other vibroswords, but with a much longer, heavier blade and an extended hilt
  accommodating a two-handed grip. Many skilled swordsmen favor the "Czerhander," which rivals a vibro-ax for hitting
  power, while granting the wielder greater control. The well-balanced blade allows for effective parrying, despite its
  size and weight.

  A vibro-greatsword requires two hands to wield.
