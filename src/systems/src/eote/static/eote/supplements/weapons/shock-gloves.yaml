name: Shock Gloves
description: >-
  Thin, metallic wires turn standard insulated gauntlets into shock gloves. Martial artists can use them to augment
  their brutal hand attacks, and more than a few nefarious rogues have been known to "seal a deal" with a handshake that
  leaves a rival convulsing on the floor.

  **Models Include**: Corellian Personal Defence X-21.
