  BlasTech SE-14C Blaster Pistol

  Of all standard issue Imperial blasters, few pack as much bang per credit as the SE-14C blaster pistol. This weapon is
  the latest BlasTech Industries upgrade of the semi-automatic SR Combat Pistol that was used by the Seperatist droid
  army at the height of the Clone Wars. The Galactic Empire contracted BlasTech to produce an alternate model with
  fully-automatic capabilities, which resulted in the SE-14r Repeater Pistol. However, overheating stemming from
  prolonged discharges of that weapon would warp the barrel, causing potentially catastrophic malfunctions.

  The SE-14C addresses the heat management issue by integrating the power pack into the back of the barrel. The clip,
  blaster gas, and barrel are changed out as a solid piece while reloading. A valve allows viable clips to be recharged
  during downtime to keep costs down. Although the Empire uses the SE-14C primarily as a sidearem, the blaster's
  intimidating reputation has made it popular among mercenaries and thieves.
