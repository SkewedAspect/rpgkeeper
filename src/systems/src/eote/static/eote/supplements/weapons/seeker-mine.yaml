name: Seeker Mine
description: >-
  Seeker mines couple a powerful explosive charge with a simple guidance and drive system to make an incredibly lethal
  piece of ordnance. When a ship enters their sensor range, seeker mines activate and pursue their target.

  If the pilot of a ship targeted by a seeker mine succeeds on the **Piloting (Space) check**, the character who set the
  mine may spend <setback></setback><setback></setback> from the check to force the pilot to repeat that check with the
  difficulty reduced by 1 (to a minimum of **Simple (-)**) at the beginning of his next turn, with the standard
  consequences for failure.
