  Thisspiasians once viewed the giant ystervark as both worthy foe and revered delicacy. Xenoarchaeologists even
  theorize the Blood Monarchy grew from ritual hunts of these creatures. Extinct in modern times, the beast's brutality
  left a lasting impression on Thisspias. For centuries, engineers sought to emulate its defensive plating and toxic
  spines.

  In keeping with this motif, ancient warrior-sages created weapons in the beast's image. Their blend of metalwork and
  the Force even parallels that of modern alchemists. For 250 years, poisoned ystervark spears were the Royal Guard's
  most iconic weapon. As the Blood Monarchy's public influence fell, so too did the ystervark's. While Thisspiasians
  still respect both, the call for such weapons has diminished. Before the rise of the Empire, only the Quillbomb
  retained its mass appeal.

  The device is not much larger than a closed fist, and wicked-looking spines litter its surface. On detonation, these
  spines rip through armor, burrowing deep into flesh. Each spine carries a dose of synthetic toxin, inspired by the
  ancient ystervark's venom. With its weak payload, the bomb is less focused on raw explosive power. Rather, it relies
  on driving at least one spine intact into a victim's body. The contagions used are often as quick as they are
  debilitating. One spine is enough to immediately impair motor functions. Any more will cause excruciating pain.

  With the Blood Monarchy outlawed by the Empire, the Quillbomb is taking on a new life as a symbol of resistance.
  Rebels searching for urban weaponry have revitalized the production of these ancient weapons. The bombs are harder to
  detect than conventional explosives, perfect for saboteurs. Storm troopers are beginning to dread missions to quash
  Thisspiasian resistance. Once the subject of mockery, the Quillbomb's body count continues to rise. True to form, the
  bomb has damaged both body and mind of the Imperial war machine. Though nowhere close in size to the ancient
  ystervark, these bombs would do it proud.
