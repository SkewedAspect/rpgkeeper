  MWC-35c "Staccato Lightning" Repeating Cannon (Single-Shot Mode)

  Morellian Weapons Conglomerate MWC-35c heavy repeating blaster cannon is one of the galaxy's premier support weapons.
  Designed to give an infantry squad unparalleled automatic fire capacity, the aptly nicknamed "Staccato Lightning"
  delivers all the power of a heavy repeating blaster in a relatively compact, easy to use package. Unlike a typical
  heavy repeating blaster that is stationary and requires a team of three dedicated gunners, the MWC-35c was designed to
  be easily portable and require less training for use. The weapon consists of a backpack-mounted, high-output energy
  generator connected to a blunt nosed heavy blaster rifle by way of an armored galven-circuitry flexible charge belt.
  While it is heavy and bulky, the generator's straps work like load-bearing gear to distribute the weight around the
  wearer's body to make it relatively easier to carry.

  While the MWC-35c works surprisingly well, it has some drawbacks. The armored cable that carries power from the
  backpack to the rifle can break or become disconnected during heavy use, making the weapon useless until repaired. The
  generator itself, although well protected, can detonate when ruptured, often killing the wearer and seriously wounding
  anyone nearby.

  The repeating cannon can be fired in two different modes. The standard mode fires in a full-automatic surge designed
  to eliminate many targets in an instant. The secondary mode fires single-shot blasts of a higher power, but requires
  priming the weapon vie the pump-action foreguard. Switching between modes requires a maneuver.

  If this weapon is ever destroyed-by a weapon with the Sunder quality or through other means determined by the Game
  Master-it blows up and deals 10 damage to the wearer and other characters within engaged range.
