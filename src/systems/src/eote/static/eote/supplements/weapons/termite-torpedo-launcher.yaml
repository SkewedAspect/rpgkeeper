name: Termite Torpedo Launcher
description: >-
  Although unlikely to inflict significant damage upon initial impact, termite torpedoes are nonetheless among the most
  hated and feared weapons in the galaxy. Each torpedo houses dozens to hundreds of small, barely intelligent droids,
  variously known as termites, dismantlers, disassemblers, and a number of less savory names. After impact, the torpedo
  breaks open to release the droids. They scurry in all directions across the ship and use their laser cutters,
  magclaws, ion clamps, and other tools to burrow through the hull and attack ship systems. In short order, the droids
  can spread throughout a ship.

  It can take weeks to clear an infestation-if the vessel survives that long. Many engineers serving with the Alliance
  (or aboard pirate crews) despise these weapons, as they make salvage difficult or downright impossible. On top of
  this, unsubstantiated rumors persist of termite droids lying dormant in salvaged systems, only to emerge and infect
  any vessel that inherits the affected parts.

  Additional termite torpedoes cost 900 credits for a set of three.
