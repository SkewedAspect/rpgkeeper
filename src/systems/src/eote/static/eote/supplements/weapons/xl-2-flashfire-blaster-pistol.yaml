name: XL-2 "Flashfire" Blaster Pistol
description: A product of the Talus Ironworks, the XL-2 "Flashfire" is one of the flashiest blasters credits can buy,
  both figuratively and literally. The XL-2 is a plasma-based blaster that emits a significant amount of highly
  energetic particles when fired. However, the design of the focusing element disperses the beam very slightly, creating
  a brilliant flash when the blaster discharges. While the power output of the blaster is not particularly impressive,
  the flash can daze and temporarily blind an opponent, giving the wielder a slight edge in a gunfight.
