name: Aurateran Boomerang
description: >-
  Although Auraterans have access to modern energy weapons, the simple but reliable boomerang is still a popular weapon
  for local hunters and trappers. The weapon takes skill to use, and many an enthusiastic amateur has lost her boomerang
  by throwing it into a tree or off a cliff. But if thrown correctly, the boomerang either hits its target or spins
  around in mid-air, then hitting the original target on the return flight or landing in the user’s hand.

  If retrieved, a thrown boomerang can be used again. A character may spend <advantage></advantage> on a missed attack
  (including an attack made with the Guided quality) to have the boomerang return to the user’s hand.
