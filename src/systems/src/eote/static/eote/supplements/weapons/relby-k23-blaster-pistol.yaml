name: Relby-K23 Blaster Pistol
description: The BlasTech Industries Relby-K23 blaster pistol is a sidearm banned from civilian purchase and used by
  agents of the Galactic Empire. It is known for its low refraction index, which results in minimal beam dispersion when
  the blaster is fired. The beam produced by this blaster pistol inflicts excruciating pain upon beings who have the
  misfortune of being hit by it. The only known drawback of the Relby-K23 is its faulty safety.
