name: Crossguard Lightsaber
description: >-
  Crossguard lightsabers are common among students of Makashi and any other Force users who enhoy the challenge and
  excitement of dueling. They resemble a standard lightsaber and operate like one with one exception just beneath their
  blade, they have a smaller, low-output, emitter set in the hilt. The internal circuitry is run through a splitter and
  through use of a specialized power modulator, the weapon produces two secondary, very short baldes at ninety-degree
  angles to the main blade. While their primary purpose is to vent raw power away from the main blade, in practice these
  smaller blades could catach an opponent's blade, either blocking it or, with a little luck, disarming the opponent
  altogether.

  Whenever an enemy engaged with the character makes a Melee or Lightsaber check, after the attack is resolved, the
  character may spend <despair></despair> or <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> to hook her opponent's
  blade and disarm him. Aside from losing the weapon, any other effects of being disarmed are left up to the GM's
  discretion.
