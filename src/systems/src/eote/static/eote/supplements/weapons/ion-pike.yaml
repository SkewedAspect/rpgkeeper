id: eote-weapon-ion-pike
name: Ion Pike
description: Used to disable escaped or malfunctioning froids, thee slender lengths of metal are flexible enough to be
  slipped between armor plating to reach vulnerable power sources and circuit banks, and are capable of releasing a
  powerful ion charge once they make contact. Using the weapons properly requires a great deal of practice, and slipping
  the probes past armor plates during the heat of a conflict or chase is difficult even for an experienced wielder.
  However, those who have seen someone slip up to a haywire industrial droid and bypass layers of protective plating to
  diable it harbor no further doubt that the pikes have their uses.
