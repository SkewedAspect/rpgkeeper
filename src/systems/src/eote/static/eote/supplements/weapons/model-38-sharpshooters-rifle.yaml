  For millennia, Czerka Arms has maintained a reputation as a purveyor of fine arms and armor for both the military and
  civilian markets. While they have an impressive and diversified catalog of offensive and defensive products ranging
  from sporting blasters and vibroblades to flame cannons and combat droids, they are perhaps best known for producing a
  successful line of fine slugthrowing pistols and rifles.

  A throwback to a more primitive age, slugthrowers are considered anachronistic and unwieldy by most sentients.
  However, Czerka's line of slugthrowers, which they refer to as "Legacy Arms," has proven modestly successful,
  especially among the beings of the Outer Rim. Some of their Legacy Arms clients are collectors or historians, others
  are farmers or colonists who appreciate the affordability and ruggedness of these firearms, and some simply prefer the
  visceral noise and flash of a chemical-propelled slug over the cool precision of a blaster. Whatever their reasons,
  whether preference or necessity, Czerka is the popular choice for slugthrowers.

  One of Czerka's more popular Legacy Arms is the Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle. Marketed to hunters, and tacitly to
  snipers and assassins, the Model 38 is an extremely powerful, accurate, long-range rifle with incredible destructive
  potential. A long and finely crafted weapon, each Model 38 is custom built to the customer's specifications. It
  chambers a powerful, large-caliber round with a specially coated penetrating bullet that can pierce even the toughest
  hides. The rifle is operated by means of a simple and rugged bolt action and fed by a five-round detachable clip.
  Their stocks and other furniture are typically either light-weight composites or polished, exotic hardwoods, depending
  on the customer's tastes.

  New rifles must be ordered in person from a certified Czerka Arms dealer, at which time the customer is measured for
  fit and his shooting style is analyzed in an on-site simulator. This allows the Czerka Arms rep to determine the best
  possible configuration for the rifle in relation to its new owner and to offer advice on further customization.

  Once the rifle is completed and delivered, it is as closely matched to the new shooter's stance, stature, and habits
  as art and artifice can make it. This makes the rifles incredibly accurate at any range, as the custom fit and frame
  makes the Model 38 point and shoot as if it were an extension of the shooter's body. Most Model 38 rifles in the Outer
  Rim are owned by hunters and marksmen for hire who ordered them directly from Czerka. There are some of these highly
  prized rifles on the used market, although they typically need serious modification before a new owner can use them to
  their full potential. If purchased used, a Czerka Model 38 loses the Accurate 2 quality until the rifle can be
  modified to fit the new shooter (requiring a **Hard
