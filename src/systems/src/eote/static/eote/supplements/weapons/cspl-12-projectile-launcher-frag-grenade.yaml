name: CSPL-12 Projectile Launcher (Frag Grenade)
description: >-
  The Empire has fielded this pistol-sized projectile

  launcher for years. The launcher can fire standard-issue frag grenades, and more than one rebel tinkerer

  has been know to retrofit it to launch non-traditional

  payloads. Because of its long career and devastating effect on the surrounding area (and anyone in it, friend

  or foe), the "Caspel" launcher has gained a notorious,

  albeit somewhat warranted, reputation as an accident-prone piece of equipment.

  The profile provided with this weapon is for frag grenades. Other grenades, such shaped thermal grenades

  and the various grenades found on page 173 of the

  **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook, can be loaded into

  the launcher. While these grenades are loaded, they

  replace the damage, critical rating, and item qualities of

  the original weapon with their own.

  The GM may spend <despair></despair> from a combat check with this

  weapon to cause it to jam. If the GM does so, the contents detonate, inflicting a hit from the loaded grenade

  on the wielder and each other character at engaged

  range. Further, the weapon becomes damaged two

  steps; from undamaged to Moderate, Minor to Major, or

  Moderate to Major (see page 172 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).The GM may spend additional
  <despair></despair>

  to trigger one of the loaded grenade’s qualities.
