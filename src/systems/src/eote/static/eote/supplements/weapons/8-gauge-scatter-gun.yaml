  Adostic Arms 8-Gauge Scatter Gun

  A powerful, large-bore slugthrower produced by Adostic Arms, their 8-gauge scatter gun fires a hail of small steel
  pellets. Though based on primitive slugthrower technology, the weapon's bestial stopping power rivals that of a heavy
  blaster pistol. Made of modern, lightweight materials, the scatter gun incorporates a sophisticated recoil system to
  reduce the weapon's big kick when fired. Many smugglers and free traders prefer these weapons to blasters for their
  ability to spray the narrow corridors and airlocks of starships without fear of accidentally penetrating the hull of
  the vessel.
