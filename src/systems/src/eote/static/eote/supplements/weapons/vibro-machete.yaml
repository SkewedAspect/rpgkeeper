name: Vibro-Machete
description: Produced by manufacturers of vibro-tools and weapons such as LaserHone and Merr-Sonn, the vibro-machete is
  one of the most common vibro-augmented blades on the galactic market. Designed and sold primarily as an agricultural
  tool, each has a long single-edged, cleaver-like blade between 30 and 45 centimeters long. The weight and balance of
  the blade combined with the long cutting edge make it perfectly suited for clearing undergrowth in dense alien forests
  and jungles, butchering large animals, and countless other wilderness tasks. The vibro-machete also makes for an
  excellent weapon, the heavy blade and vibro field emitter making short work of the unprotected and lightly armored
  opponants.
