description: >-
  In the galaxy at large, if Lothal is known at all, it is as an Imperial world home to a Sienar Fleet Systems
  production line for TIE fighters. Some Imperials also know it as a source of Rebel activity. But for generations of
  Jedi, the planet was known for its hidden temple, which safeguarded a Force-shrouded source of the kyber crystals
  utilized in lightsaber construction.

  Hidden deep within the temple are the remains of the Rodian Jedi Lodaka. An unparalleled master of the third form of
  lightsaber dueling, Soresu, the Rodian was unusual among Jedi for also spending much of her time mastering a
  discipline not often thought of in conjunction with the order: physics. Specifically, Lodaka was fascinated by the
  material properties of the various crystals used in lightsaber construction, and she took a disciplined, reasoned
  approach to their study. A true scientist, she made careful, controlled experiments with many forms of crystals, both
  natural and manufactured, concentrating her efforts on modifications in the form of chemical coatings. She theorized
  that the effects of the different forms of crystals used in lightsabers could be enhanced by manipulating the
  crystalline structure of the base crystal. Although she used modern grav-field projectors and micromanipulators to
  conduct her experiments, it is thought she only achieved success when she manipulated the crystals on a molecular
  level using the Force.

  All of Lodaka’s notes and papers were either destroyed or taken when the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was overrun
  following the implementation of Order 66. Only one of the crystals she modified is thought to still exist, and it is
  the one in her own lightsaber, which remains with her body on Lothal. It represented Lodaka’s finest work, as the
  particular modification she applied at least partially addressed a problem that had vexed lightsaber wielders for
  thousands of years.

  Master Lodaka’s Lightsaber is a weapon with the following profile: (Lightsaber; Damage 10; Critical 1; Range
  [Engaged]; Breach 1, Sunder, Vicious 2).

  Master Lodaka’s Lightsaber has an encumbrance of 1 and zero hard points. Attacks made with this lightsaber ignore the
  Cortosis quality. It also cannot be shut down due to contact with refined cortosis.
