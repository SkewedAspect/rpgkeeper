name: DL-7h Heavy Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  These weighty, deadly pistols are a favorite of both smugglers and mercenaries. Powerful enough to punch straight
  through laminate armor, the DL-7H's reputation is well-deserved. In fact, the weapon packs so much power into a pistol
  that many worlds with otherwise lax blaster regulations have outlawed it. In order to boost damage, the DL-7H draws
  heavily from its power cell, draining it quickly. Another effect of the weapon's unique power draw is its lack of a
  stun setting.

  The GM may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> to cause a Player Character's DL-7H to run out of ammo.
