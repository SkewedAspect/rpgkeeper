  Loronar Spray Rifle

  The Loronar spray rifle fires a highly pressurized stream of fluid. The fluid affects its target by carrying a
  powerful sedative suspended in an organic solvent. That substance is easily absorbed through the skin, carrying the
  sedative directly into the target's bloodstream. In addition to penetrating the skin of almost all known species, the
  fluid is capable of penetrating many types of armor, including ones designed to be environmentally sealed. This makes
  the spray rifle a useful weapon against targets wearing equipment that could stop an airborne sedative. However,
  because the stream must be carefully targeted, it is less effective against crowds than a non-lethal gas attack.

  The spray rifle's ammunition is stored in a transparent metallic canister, which attaches as a clip. The weapon also
  has a one-liter cylindrical tank that stores the compressed air used to propel its payload. This is normally refilled
  from a preasure canister after firing three to four canisters of ammunition.
