name: Corellian Cutlass
description: Traditionally granted to Corellian naval officers upon being promoted from ensign or sub-lieutenant to full
  lieutenant, the Corellian cutlass is a relatively short, broad saber with a solid hand guard. While generally
  considered little more than ornamental blade, the weight and craftsmanship of the cutlass makes it an effective weapon
  in close combat. Some Corellian free-traders who previously served in the navy retain their cutlasses and continue to
  wear them.
