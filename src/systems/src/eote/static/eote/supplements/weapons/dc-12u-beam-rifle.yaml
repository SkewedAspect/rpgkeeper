description: >-
  BlasTech's DC-12U is an uncommon weapon designed for underwater operations. Built for the GAR's clone dive troopers,
  the DC-12U was developed from the C290, an older BlasTech blaster rifle built for use in wet, humid, or swampy
  environments. It's a heavy, two-barreled weapon equipped with a collapsing stock and an integrated under-barrel mount.
  It fires two low-output blaster bolts with one pull of the trigger and is devastating in the right hands. Thanks to
  its particular mix of blaster gases and the special focusing elements used to optimize underwater performance. the
  DC-1 2U fires blue bolts instead of the typical red bolts fired by most weapons. 

  The under-barrel mount typically mounts a high-powered flashlight that removes <setback></setback> due to darkness
  from any combat checks made with the weapon. When outside of an aquatic environment, the DC-12U has the Inaccurate 2
  item quality.
