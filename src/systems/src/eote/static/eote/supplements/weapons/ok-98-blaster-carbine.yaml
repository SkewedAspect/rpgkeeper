name: OK-98 Blaster Carbine
description: >-
  The OK-98 is unique in that the weapon features slots for two power packs. An onboard computer automatically switches
  to the second power pack once the first is depleted, so that a user reloads half as frequently as with a typical
  blaster. Because blasters require such infrequent reloading in the first place, this feature proved to be of secondary
  concern to most buyers, who were put off by the weapon's extra weight in comparison to similarly sized carbines. As a
  result, the OK-98 sold poorly and SoroSuub discontinued production of the model after only six years. The weapon has
  since found new life on the black market thanks to an illegal modification that allows it to draw from both packs
  simultaneously. This does enhance the damage output of the weapon, but also wears out several components in a
  comparably short time. The modification is fairly sensitive, and a poorly-modified weapon can be quite dangerous to
  the user.

  A character using an OK-98 can ignore the first "out of ammo" <despair></despair> result during a combat, just as with
  an extra power pack, without expending a maneuver.

  A modified OK-98 (requiring an **Easy (<difficulty></difficulty>) Mechanics check**) increases weapon damage by 2,
  replacing the option to ignore the first "out of ammo" result. The GM can spend <despair></despair> to have a modified
  OK-98 catastrophically overheat and explode, inflicting one hit from the weapon (dealing base damage) on the user and
  destroying the weapon after the attack has been resolved.
