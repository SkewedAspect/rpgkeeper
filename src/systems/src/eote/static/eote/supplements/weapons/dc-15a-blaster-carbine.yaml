name: DC-15A Blaster Carbine
description: BIasTech's DC-15A blaster carbine is the GAR’s standard-issue carbine. Every clone, from the greenest
  recruit to the most seasoned special operator, can use the DC-15A from the moment they are decanted. A lighter,
  shorter-ranged cousin of the heavy and cantankerous DC-15. The DC-15A is accurate, easy to handle, and as reliable as
  a chrono.
