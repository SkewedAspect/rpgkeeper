description: >-
  Technicians need not only the ability to cut metal apart quickly, but the capacity to fuse back together. A welding
  rod works on a simple principle, generating a jet of focused heat that liquefies small parts of two or more pieces of
  metal, creating a sturdy bond between the formerly separate pieces. The heat involved is in this process is extremely
  dangerous to organic creatures and can even sear clean through the much sturdier limbs of droids. For good reason,
  welding rods are typically sold with instruction manuals that highlight the danger involved in their use - which some
  Technicians choose to actively ignore when threatened in their workshops.

  A welding rod adds automatic <success></success> to Mechanics checks checks to repair droids, vehicles and starships.

  The GM may spend <despair></despair> on any check made with a welding rod to inflict a Critically Injury (see page 216
  of the **Edge of The Empire** Core Rulebook) on the user.
