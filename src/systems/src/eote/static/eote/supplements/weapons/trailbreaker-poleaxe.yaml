  LaserHone Trailbreaker Poleaxe

  LaserHone's Trailbreaker is a versatile piece of equipment designed for exploration, search and rescue, and wilderness
  survival. Each consists of a long, thin, low-profile axe blade mounted to a sturdy fibermesh reinforced plasteel haft
  roughly two meters in length. It is popular among scouts and explorers who appreciate its utility both as a tool and
  as a weapon. The Trailbreaker's length and sturdy build make it both a fine walking staff and an excellent tool for
  prying, propping, and levering large objects. The head of the axe, sporting a finely honed, monomolecular edge, can
  cut through undergrowth, small trees, and even flesh and bone with relative ease. In the right hands, the Trailbreaker
  is an extremely potent, versatile tool, and its popularity increases with every sale.

  The Trailbreaker poleaxe requires two hands to use.
