name: Thunderbolt Shock Prod
description: A particularly brutal weapon used to herd thick skinned creatures and, on occasion, sentient beings, the
  Thunderbolt Shock Prod produced by SoroSuub is a weapon with a mixed reputation throughout the galaxy. At once the
  symbol of bucolic agricultural life and brutally oppressive regimes, the Thunderbolt consists of a solid alloy staff
  nearly two meters long. At one end is a heavily insulated, two-handed grip and at the other is a series of sharp
  prongs. The prongs aren't the main threat posed by these weapons, however. Rather, it is the powerful electrical shock
  generated by them. Able to produce an electrical arc powerful enough to tame a krayt dragon, the Thunderbolt is
  popular among planetary security forces and slavers, and judicious use of these weapons by riot police can disperse a
  violent crowd in minutes. The effects of the noise and the crippling pain from the shock quickly incapacitate even the
  most determined rioters, and these weapons are infamous throughout the galaxy.
