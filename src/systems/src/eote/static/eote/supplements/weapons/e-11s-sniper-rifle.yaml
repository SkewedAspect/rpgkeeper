name: E-11S Sniper Rifle
description: >-
  Developed from the venerable E-11 blaster rifle, BlasTech's E-11s was designed primarily as a dedicated marksman's
  rifle for use by the Galactic Empire. A large, sleek, and deadly-looking weapon, the E-11s is nearly as long as a
  grown human is tall, with a shroud-ed barrel that makes up fully half of its length. Excellent balance and
  precision-fit components help compensate for this, however, and the E-11 s is quite easy to carry and shoot for a
  weapon of its size. The E-1Is is incredibly popular among the Empire's scout and reconnaissance forces, whose missions
  typically see them operating in conditions where the long range and pinpoint accuracy of a dedicated sniper weapon can
  be used to their fullest potential. In the field, the E-11s grants a small reconnaissance squad incredible reach and
  allows them to project their force at ranges unmatched by most military units. Officially, the E-11 s carries a
  restricted rating, limiting it to governmental, military, and law-enforcement use only. That being said, more than a
  few of these powerful rifles have fallen out of the backs of speeder trucks, so to speak. Those that have found their
  way into civilian hands make for excellent hunting and sniping weapons, and their performance nearly makes up for the
  serious risks involved in owning them.

  E-11s rifles are equipped with relatively light-weight, matte-finish composite furniture that absorbs light, a fixed
  stock, and a powerful multioptical telescopic sight. The rifle's firing mechanism uses a supercharged actuating
  module, upgraded exciter, and extremely volatile, highly compressed blaster gasses to increase the range and
  penetration of the blaster bolt. This extra power has the added side effect of reducing refraction and beam
  degradation, allowing it to maintain both its penetration and stopping power at incredible range. While this makes for
  a powerful weapon, especially in the hands of a talented marksman, it also makes for a weapon that consumes quite a
  bit of energy and as such has a limited ammunition capacity (a rarity in blasters). These rifles also emit an enormous
  amount of heat when firing, thanks to their supercharged firing systems. To compensate for this, the E-11 s has a slow
  rate of fire to allow for cool-down, and the barrel is insulated with a triple-redundant nitrogen cooling system.
