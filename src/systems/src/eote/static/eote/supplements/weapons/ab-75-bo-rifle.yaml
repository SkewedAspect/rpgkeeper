  During the Republic, the Bo-Rifle was the ceremonial weapon of the Honor Guard of Lasan. These Lasat were impressive
  Warriors, and their bo-rifles were equally impressive. Designed to be used in both close quarters and at range, these
  weapons could quickly be converted from a high-powered blaster rifle to a double-headed staff. At each end of the
  staff, brilliant arcs of electricity crackled and spat. A skilled Lasat could use the electrified staff to shock
  opponents into submission; provided they hadn't bludgeoned them half to death first.

  After the Empire invaded Lasan and wiped out the population, some high-ranking officers took these weapons as
  trophies. These days, the only place one is likely to find a bo-rifle is in the collection of some Imperial commander.

  As a maneuver, the user can convert the bo-rifle from its ranged mode to melee mode. A bo-rifle requires two hands to
  wield.
