name: Flechette Micro-Rocket
description: The warheads of flechette rockets detonate just before impact, releasing a cloud of razor-edged metal
  shards to lacerate the target, or anyone unfortunate enough to be nearby. They lack the penetration of an explosive
  charge, much less a dedicated anti-armor warhead, but the flechettes inflict devastating wounds nevertheless. Bounty
  hunters who hunt huge beasts or predators sometimes favor flechette rockets, as they can disable such creatures over
  several volleys.
