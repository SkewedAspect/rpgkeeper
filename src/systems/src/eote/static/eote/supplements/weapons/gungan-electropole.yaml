name: Gungan Electropole
description: >-
  Gungan herders traditionally use electropoles to guide and guard their shaaks. Though it is essentially a peasant
  weapon, familiarity led the Gungan militia members to incorporate it into their military traditions. While herders
  typically used the weapon while afoot, militias often use electropoles while mounted upon kaadu. Its relatively low
  weight makes it well suited for use in one hand while controlling a mount with the other. Because electropoles were
  designed for controlling cattle as well as scaring off predators, the weapons incorporate both stun and deadly
  settings. The electronic components of an electropole are watertight, so they can be used effectively on land or
  underwater.

  An electropole may be thrown as a ranged weapon. If used in this manner, change the skill to Ranged (Light) and the
  range of the weapon to short. The weapon also gains the Limited Ammo 1 quality (but can be retrieved and used again).
