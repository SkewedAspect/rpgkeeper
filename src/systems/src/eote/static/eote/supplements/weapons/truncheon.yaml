name: Truncheon
description: Truncheons may be made of metal, wood, bone or other materials, but all fulfill the same basic
  function—bruising flesh, breaking bones, and cracking skulls. Police forces around the galaxy use truncheons to
  intimidate and control protesters or petty thieves. Enlightened areas prefer this to lethal force.
