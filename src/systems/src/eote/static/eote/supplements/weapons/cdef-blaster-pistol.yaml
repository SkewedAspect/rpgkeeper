name: CDEF Blaster Pistol
description: A basic, cheap design manufactured by Corellian Arms, a subsidiary of the Corellian Engineering
  Corporation, the CDEF blaster pistol is the standard sidearm issued to CorSec officers. While it lacks the stopping
  power of many other comparable light blasters, the weapon's relatively small size, reliability, and ease of
  maintenance have kept it in service with CorSec since before the Clone Wars.
