  Prax Arms Stealth-2VX Palm Shooter

  One of the smallest, most easily concealed weapons in the galaxy, the Prax Arms Stealth-2VX Palm Shooter fits easily
  in the cupped palm of a human-sized hand, making it virtually undetectable by the casual observer. While its darts
  themselves are not particularly lethal, the toxins contained within the darts can be quite deadly.

  Each dart can be loaded with 1 dose of neuro-toxin, anesthetic, or neuroparalytic (see page 172 of the **Edge of the
  Empire** Core Rulebook) Or any other poison (such as those on page 109) the GM deems appropriate. Whenever the wielder
  successfully attacks a target with the weapon (whether or not he deals damage), the target also suffers the effects of
  being exposed to the poison.

  Add <setback></setback><setback></setback> to Perception checks to find a Stealth-2VX Palm Shooter on a wearer's body.
