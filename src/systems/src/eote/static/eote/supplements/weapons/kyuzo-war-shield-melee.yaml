  Kyuzo War Shield

  Originally utilitarian in function, the Kyuzo war shield

  was designed by the inhabitants of the Kwaidan

  Peaks, as a headpiece to protect travelers from torrential rains during monsoon season in southern Phatrong. Over
  time, the Sulddo warriors began to fashion

  helmets in this style from stronger materials able to

  withstand the blaster bolts and vibroblade strikes of

  lawless bandits plaguing the countryside. Eventually,

  the war shield transformed into a defensive weapon,

  each fabricated by its owner to fulfill a variety of uses,

  fighting styles, and decorative tastes.

  A Kyuzo war shield may be thrown as a ranged

  weapon. If used in this manner, change the skill to

  Ranged (Light) and the range of the weapon to short.

  The weapon also gains the Limited Ammo 1 quality

  (but if retrieved, it can be used again).

  Additionally, the wielder of a Kyuzo war shield may

  spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> from any combat check to throw the

  weapon to cause the shield to ricochet back to her grasp.
