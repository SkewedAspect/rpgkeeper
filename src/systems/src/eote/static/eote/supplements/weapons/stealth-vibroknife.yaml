name: Stealth Vibroknife
description: >-
  Popular among all manner of individuals from nobles to vagabonds, vibroblades are effective cutting edges that, when
  powered, can easily slice through light armor. Compared to traditional melee weapons, a vibroweapon can be smaller,
  but still extremely deadly. Many corporations have sought to fill this niche by producing vibroknives with a bare
  minimum of technology—essentially a naked blade with a thin handle and miniaturized motivator. Such blades can be
  correspondingly more dangerous to wield, but they offer the advantage of being easily hidden and difficult to detect.

  Add <setback></setback><setback></setback> to a character's Perception checks to find a stealth vibroknife on a
  person's body.

  **Models include:** Palandrix Compact Utility Blade.
