name: BR-219 Heavy Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  The BR-219 is a rare, high performance heavy blaster pistol produced by BlasTech. A large, intimidating weapon, the
  BR-219 has a short, thick barrel with a broad aperture, a heavy-duty frame, and a custom grip with an integral recoil
  compensation system. These super-heavy pistols were developed in response to requests from bounty hunters and law
  enforcement agencies for a powerful, pistol-sized weapon for use in taking down particularly dangerous opponents. To
  meet the demand, BlasTech turned to one of its most popular and well-respected product lines and developed the BR-219
  from its E-11 series of millitary blaster rifles.

  Using the E-11's reciever and firing mechanism, BlasTech engineers then reengineered the XCiter and actuating module
  to produce an overcharged bolt, equipped the drastically shortened barrel with an improved Galven pattern, and
  developed a special and highly volatile blend of blaster gases to feed their new weapon. All of this enhanced
  technology combined with the new bespoke blaster gas made for an extremely powerful—if slightly inaccurate and
  finicky—pistol. The bolt from the BR-219 is nearly as powerful as the E-11, and the weapon produces a tremendous noise
  and muzzle flash when fired. It is neither a subtle nor a restrained weapon; openly carrying one of these massive
  pistols makes an eloquent point about the user's intentions.

  The BR-219 is not sold through BlasTech's usual dealer network. Instead, the weapon must be custom ordered straight
  from the factory. A thorough Imperial Security Bureau background check and a specially issued carry permit are
  required to purchase one of these weapons legally. Of course, this background check can be circumvented by purchasing
  the pistol on the black market or acuiring it through other less-than-legal means. Carrying a BR-219 without the
  proper permit is a risky business, and being found with an illegally purchased model is grounds for immediate Imperial
  imprisonment. Using a BR-219 in combat for an extended period of time is,  to the least, quite hazardous. The immense
  heat generated by the high-performance blaster gas and the overcharged action of the firing mechanism put an
  incredible amount of strain on the weapon.

  GMs may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> from a check to cause the BR-219 to become damaged one step
  (undamaged to minot, minor to moderate, etc.) and suffer the penalties listed on page 166 of the **Force and Destiny**
  Core Rulebook until repaired. In addition, Game Masters may spend <despair></despair> to cause the BR-219 to melt down
  and explode, destroying the weapon and dealing the weapon's base damage to the user.
