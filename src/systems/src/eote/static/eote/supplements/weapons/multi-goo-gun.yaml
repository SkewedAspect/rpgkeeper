description: >-
  The multi-goo gun, an all-in-one spray injector, has a self-cleaning element that allows Technicians to switch out
  lubricant, adhesive or acid cartridges with no loss in function. The device apeals to many machinists' natural
  affinity for efficiency, enabling users to switch between substances quickly without stopping their work, rather than
  having to stop, clean their spray injectors and load them with a new substance at each step of a project.

  A character using this tool gains automatic <advantage></advantage> on Mechanics checks to repair droids, vehicles or
  starships.

  The GM may spend <threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> on a Mechanics or combat check made using a

  multi-goo gun requires an action.
