name: Morgukai Cortosis Staff
description: >-
  Relics of the Morgukai, an ancient Nikto warrior society that hunted Jedi and Sith alike, these weapons are
  exceedingly rare. Crafted using lightsaber-resistant cortosis ore, the staves emit energy blades very similar to those
  of lightsabers. The Morgukai were declared an outlawed religious cult by the Galactic Empire and have long been
  thought extinct like the Jedi they once fought.

  The cortosis staff requires two hands to wield.
