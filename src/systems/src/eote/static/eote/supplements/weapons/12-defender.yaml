name: 12 Defender
description: >-
  Described as a "micro blaster" in advertising literature, the 12 Defender holdout blaster by Gee-Tech is a weapon of
  dubious quality and legality. Touted as the smallest, most reliable self-defense blaster for sale in the galaxy," this
  tiny pistol is a light, easily concealable, low-powered holdout blaster marketed to wealthy individuals such as
  merchants, entertainers, and politicians. In theory, the 12 Defender is perfect for those who need a bit of personal
  protection but have no need or desire to carry a larger blaster pistol. In practice, however, this tiny pistol is a
  cheaply made, largely disposable weapon of questionable reliability. Produced in the millions and possessing no
  distinguishing markings (not even a serial number) these weapons feature a ceraplas frame coated with a non-reactive
  polymer case, which makes them incredibly light and nearly invisible to weapon detection systems. They carry only two
  shots in their integral power pack, and, once fired, cannot be recharged and retain only a small amount of scrap
  value.

  While the 12 Defender certainly does offer a fair amount of protection for the price, its shoddy construction and lack
  of versatility limits its usefulness to the average galactic citizen. However, due to its ease of concealment, ability
  to elude scanners, untraceable components, and disposable nature, this tiny pistol has found an avid following among
  the criminal classes.
