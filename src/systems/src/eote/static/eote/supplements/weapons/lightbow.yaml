name: Lightbow
description: >-
  A distinctive part of each Guardian of the Whill's spiritual progression on Jedha, lightbows are traditionally
  constructed by hand upon completion of the seventh duan towards physical perfection. They have two limbs containing
  polarizing arrays to stabilize firing. These extend outwards and so make lightbows resemble Wookiee bowcasters, but
  the limbs on lightbows can be collapsed for easier transport. A sophisticated auto-loading system loads, cocks, and
  fires with every pull of the trigger, emitting a powerful charged particle.

  The user may spend a maneuver to collapse the weapon for regular transport (reducing its encumbrance to 3) or expand
  the arrays to ready it for firing.
