name: Wrist Blaster
description: >-
  Wrist blasters are custom-made self-defense weapons worn by diplomats, espionage agents, businesspeople, and other
  individuals who need an inconspicuous personal defense weapon. Typically built into a bracelet or large-framed chrono,
  these weapons fire an extremely powerful blast at little more than arm's length. Good for only one shot, the blaster
  mechanism focuses all of its power into a single, high-powered blast that can penetrate most armor and can
  incapacitate or even kill the toughest opponent in the blink of an eye. Despite their utility, wrist blasters have a
  number of downsides. They are illegal on most worlds, although that doesn't stop individuals from using them. In
  addition, their range is pitifully short: users must be almost touching their target for the weapon to have any
  effect. Finally, since wrist blasters are only good for one shot, a user is put in a precarious situation if the blast
  fails to incapacitate or kill the intended target.

  Noticing that an individual is wearing a wrist blaster requires a **Daunting
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Perception check**. At the Game Master's
  discretion, <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> can be spent on a user's Ranged
  (Light) check to have the weapon burn the user and deal 5 wounds.
