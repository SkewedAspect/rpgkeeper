name: CS14 "Ghost" Light Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  Small, lightweight, and easily concealed, BlasTech's CS14 is one of the galaxy's premier personal defense blasters.
  One of the smallest blaster pistols on the market, the CS14 is marketed primarily to detectives, investigators, and
  other individuals who need a powerful yet easy-to-conceal weapon for daily carry. Roughly the size and weight of a
  standard holdout blaster, the CS14 is built using lightweight polycarbonates and sensor-proof alloys. This makes the
  weapon nearly invisible to most common weapon scanners. On an individual with the right holster and clothing, it is
  very difficult to detect without an extremely thorough search. Since its introduction, state intelligence agencies
  throughout the galaxy have adopted the CS14 as a standard-issue weapon for field agents.

  Finding a CS14 on an individual requires a **Daunting
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Perception
  check**. A character must make a **Daunting
  (<difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>) Computers
  check** to find the CS14 with a weapon scanner. The difficulty of the latter check can be reduced by one or two levels
  at the Game Master's discretion, depending on the type of scanner being used and the attentiveness of the operator.
