name: SWE/2 Sonic Rifle
description: Known primarily for their finely designed skiffs and robust security systems, Telex-Delcor also produces a
  line of reliable and easy-to-use non-lethal riot control devices. One of their more unique offerings is the SWE/2
  Sonic Rifle. A refinement of the SWE/1 Sonic Suppressor released during the Clone Wars, the SWE/2 is a long-barrelled
  firearm designed to incapacitate even the toughest, most persistent malcontent. Using a powerful acoustic generator,
  the SWE/2 fires a concentrated beam of sound waves similar in power and performance to the particle beam packets fired
  by blasters. When used on sentient beings, this weapon affects the targets' hearing and sense of balance, staggering
  the targets and shorting out their fine motor centers. Similar to its Clone Wars-era predecessor, the sonic blast
  generated by the SWE/2 cannot be parried or disrupted by a lightsaber; a very attractive feature during the end of the
  Clone Wars, but of limited usefulness today.
