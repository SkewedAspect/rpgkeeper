  Czerka Arms C-10 "Dragoneye Reaper" Heavy Blaster Pistol

  Based on a custom made design by the infamous bounty hunter Dragoneye, Czerka Arms C-10 heavy blaster pistol has
  become a popular sidearm for bounty hunters, smugglers, and other (ringers who value firepower over subtlety. Larger
  than most other heavy blasters, the Dragoneye Reaper is nearly as lethal as some blaster rifles, and users can easily
  modify it to suit their needs. While Czerka owns the rights to the Dragoneye Reaper, Caliban's Model X and SoroSuub
  "Renegade' heavy blaster pistols share many design elements and bear a striking resemblance to the C-10.
