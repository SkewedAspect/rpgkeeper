name: '"Subduer-9" Riot Blaster'
description: >-
  Although just as heavy and unwieldly as many more lethal weapons, riot blasters lack stopping power in the traditional
  sense, as these bulky blaster varients are very unlikely to do lasting harm. Instead, riot blasters are built to
  enhance the effectiveness of the stun setting common to blaster weapons. The "Subduer-9" model is noteworthy for it
  can maintain a coherent stun blast over a wide area, reducing the risk of collateral damage or unintended injury to
  the target.

  Given these capabilites, many peacekeeping forces equip their troops with riot blasters, or at least keep the powerful
  weapons on hand for major civil disturbances. While obviously preferable to the alternative, the willingness with
  which some Imperial commanders deploy the weapons at the slightest provocation has given them an unsavory repuation in
  the eyes of many. Nevertheless, they are a welcome addition to the armory of any hunter who prefers to take targets
  alive and avoid incental harm to others.
