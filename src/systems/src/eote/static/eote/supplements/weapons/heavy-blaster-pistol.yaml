name: Heavy Blaster Pistol
description: >-
  Heavy blasters are for those spacers who definitely want everyone to know they're packing. They're very powerful,
  sacrificing range, subtlety, and concealment for intimidation and the ability to tear big holes in most anything short
  of a blast door. Heavy blaster pistols are intended to combine the strength of a blaster rifle with the compactness of
  a pistol. Though they do not quite succeed at either (being slightly weaker than a blaster rifle and bulkier than a
  pistol) they still provide an excellent and deadly compromise weapon. Their only major drawback is that they carry
  fewer shots than either, a trade-off for the increased power.

  Game Masters have the option to spend <threat></threat><threat></threat><threat></threat> or <despair></despair> to
  force a heavy blaster pistol to run out of ammo (see page 207).
