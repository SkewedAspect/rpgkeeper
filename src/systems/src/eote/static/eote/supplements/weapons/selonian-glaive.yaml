name: Selonian Glaive
description: Individually crafted by Selonian females as a rite of passage, the Selonian glaive is a unique work of art
  as much as it is a weapon. At maturity, a female is expected to collect the materials need to create the glaive
  herself, and wielding the weapon in battle is a mark of worth among the Selonians. A heavy wooden pole, typically
  about two meters in length, forms the body of the weapon, with a large, razor-sharp obsidian blade attached to one end
  and obsidian hooks and barbs affixed to the other end. A peculiar mineral in Selonian obsidian makes the volcanic
  glass more stable and far less brittle than normal, giving it unusual strength and toughness, as well as a distinctive
  iridescent quality. The edge of the glaive's blade is mere nanometers thick, allowing it to slice through armor,
  flesh, and bone with contemptuous ease.
