name: Sith Shield
description: >-
  The shields used by Sith warriors in ages past can still be found, though they are rare in the extreme. Resembling
  ordinary shields at first glance, Sith shields are crafted from an alchemical alloy and are often decorated with
  unsettling carvings, reliefs and runes. They are virtually inpenetrable, even to lightsabers, and these shields are
  incredbily deadly in the hands of a trained dark side adept. When used in combat by a Force user, Sith shields absorb
  the hate of combatants around them, drawing upon the building fury of their users and any foes engaged in the
  struggle.

  Whenever a Force-sensitive wielder of a Sith shield sufers a hit in combat, he may commit [FO] to channel his fury
  into the shield as an out of turn incidental. Over multiple attacks, he may commit multiple [FO] this way, up to a
  total number [FO] no greater than his force rating.

  AS an action, the wielder may uncommit all [FO] committed to the Sith shield to unleash the stored power in a torrent
  of hate. When he does so, he gains Conflict equal to the number of [FO] he had committed to the shield and then he
  makes a Force power check with that many [FO]. He may spend <forcepoint></forcepoint> to inflict 1 wound and 1 strain
  (these ignore soak) on each other character within short range of him; he may activate this multiple times, inflicting
  1 additional wound and 1 additional strain each time.
