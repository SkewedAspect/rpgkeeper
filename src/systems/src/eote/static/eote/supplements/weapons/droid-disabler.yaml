  Felebreck Droid Disabler

  Produced by Felebreck Electrical Defense Systems, the Droid Disabler is a small but powerful ionization pistol
  intended to damage, rather than merely incapacitate, droids. Though ineffective at anything but very short ranges, the
  massive ion blast emitted by a Droid Disabler can permanently fuse the circuits of virtually any unshielded droid,
  leaving it nothing more than a heap of lifeless scrap. Though devastating to droids and cybernetics, the ion blast
  doesn't harm living tissue. Due to the compact size of the energy cell and the large power requirements of the weapon,
  the Droid Disabler can only be fired a few times before the energy pack needs to be replaced.
