name: Character Death
description: When the Naaz or the Rokha is killed, you may choose to retire your character (with the living member of
  the pair retiring from adventuring and going into mourning) or continue playing with only one member of the pair (but
  in this case, you cannot add a 'new' member to replace the dead one).
