name: Terrifying Appearance Improved
description: At the start of an encounter, all opponents must make an upgraded Daunting as an out-of-turn incidental, as
  per page 243 of the Genesys Core Rulebook. If there are multiple sources of fear in the encounter, the opponents only
  make one fear check against the most fearsome enemy.
