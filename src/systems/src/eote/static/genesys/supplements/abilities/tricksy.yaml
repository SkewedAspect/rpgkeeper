description: Once per encounter during their turn, a Wanderer Gnome may use this ability and spend a Story Point to
  produce a previously undocumented small item (encumbrance 1 or less) with a rarity no greater than 4 from a pocket,
  bag, pouch, nearby windowsill, passing cart, or other convenient location—even if there is no logical explanation for
  the item's presence. This item cannot be a weapon unless the weapon has the Limited Ammo 1 quality.
