name: "Æffects: Find"
description: May use the effect to locate a particular creature or object at a very great distance, potentially any
  where on the Crucible. The target must be a being, object, or creature that this character has personally encountered
  before. This power gives them an unerring sense of the direction and distance to the target while they are using the
  power, but not of any intervening obstacles, their surroundings, or other details. If the target does not want to be
  found (or if someone intentionally hid the object), this should require an opposed Æmbercraft or Stealth}. The process
  of using the power generally take too long to occur during structure gameplay.
