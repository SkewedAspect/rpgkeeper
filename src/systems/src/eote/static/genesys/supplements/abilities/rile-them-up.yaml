description: Once per encounter, may make an <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> targeting a group of
  bystanders or other neutral NPCs at medium range; if the check is successful, one of the bystanders (plus one per
  additional <success></success>) becomes a Human First Extremist; these NPCs form a single minion group and join the
