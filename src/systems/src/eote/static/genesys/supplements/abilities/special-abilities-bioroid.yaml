name: Special Abilities (Bioroid)
description: Bioroids do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and are unaffected by toxins and poisons. Bioroids do not
  reduce their strain threshold when they receive cybernetics (in the case of bioroids, the cybernetics can represent
  upgraded mechanical components instead of true cybernetics).
