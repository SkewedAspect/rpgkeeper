name: The Beast Within
description: Mongrels generally look just like any other human. However, when your character is incapacitated due to
  exceeding their strain threshold while in human form, they undergo the following change as an out-of-turn incidental.
  They heal all strain; increase their Brawn and Agility by one, to a maximum of 5; and reduce their Intellect and
  Willpower by one to a minimum of 1. They deal +1 damage when making unarmed attacks, and their unarmed attacks have a
  Crit rating of 3. In addition, their jaws elongate into muzzles, their hair thickens and they grow more all over their
  bodies, and their eyes become those of a hunting cat or wolf. Your GM should ensure that NPCs react appropriately to
  this (at the very least, upgrading the difficulty of all social skill checks twice). Your character reverts to human
  form after eight hours, or if they are incapacitated (by exceeding either their wound threshold or their strain
  threshold).
