description: As reanimated corpses, revenants have several quirks, some beneficial and some detrimental. Your character
  does not recover wounds through natural rest, but they add <boost></boost><boost></boost> to any Medicine checks to
  heal them (they don't flinch). Your character also cannot be affected by poisons (although they must be wary of
  insects and carrion feeders trying to make a meal from or to nest on their bodies). As with mongrel, your GM should
  ensure that NPCs react appropriately if they are aware of your character's condition (at the very least, upgrading the
  difficulty of your character's social skill checks twice). Also, perfume is a good idea. Lots of perfume.
