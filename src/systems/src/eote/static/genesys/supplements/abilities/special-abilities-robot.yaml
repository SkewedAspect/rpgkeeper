description: Robots do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and are unaffected by toxins and poisons. If you are using
  the cybernetics rules from the science fiction setting (see page 177), robots do not reduce their strain threshold
  when they receive cybernetics (the cybernetics can represent upgraded mechanical components instead of true
  cybernetics).
