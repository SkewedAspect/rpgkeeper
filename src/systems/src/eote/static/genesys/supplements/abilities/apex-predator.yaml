description: At the start of their first turn in the encounter, all opponents must make a
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> as an out-of-turn incidental. If they
  fail, they are immobilized until the start of their next turn. If they fail with <despair></despair>, they are
  staggered until the start of their next turn instead. If you're using the fear rules (see page 243), this counts as a
  fear check, and other effects may apply as well.
