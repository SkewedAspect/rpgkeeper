name: Terrifying Aura
description: At the start of an encounter, all opponents must make an upgraded Hard as an out-of-turn incidental, as per
  page 243 of the Genesys Core Rulebook. If there are multiple sources of fear in the encounter, the opponents only make
  one fear check against the most fearsome enemy.
