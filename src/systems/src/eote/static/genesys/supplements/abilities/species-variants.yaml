description: Your character can start the game either as an air-breathing Hylar or as a water-breathing Hylar. If they
  start the game as an air-breathing Hylar, they can also function normally in all oxygen atmospheres. If they start the
  game as a water-breathing Hylar, they gain 5 additional starting XP. However, if exposed to the air, they follow the
  rules for drowning (see page 111 of the Core Rulebook). They also start the game with a sealed environmental suit (see
  page 117).
