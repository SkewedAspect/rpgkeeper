name: Incorporeal
description: Your character lacks corporeal presence. When your character makes Brawn- or Agility-based checks, increase
  the difficulty by two. When a corporeal character makes a Brawn- or Agility-based check targeting your character,
  increase the difficulty by two. Your character increases their soak by their Willpower (in addition to their Brawn).
  Your character can move through most mundane types of difficult and impassable terrain without penalty (but cannot
  stop inside solid surfaces). None of the preceding effects of this rule apply while your character is wearing armor.
  In addition, your character does not need to eat, breathe, or sleep.
