name: Pike
description: "Essentially very long, two-handed spears, pikes are the ultimate defensive weapons. Their reach (between
  ten and twenty feet) means they can be used to attack a foe long before the foe can bring their own weapon to bear.
  However, pikes are nearly useless in close quarters. The Lorimor Empire fields companies of pikes: soldiers who are
  trained to stand shoulder to shoulder and create a bristling hedgehog of spearheads four or five layers deep. A pike
  can be used to make melee attacks against targets at short range (the difficulty remains
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>), but it cannot be used to attack engaged targets."
