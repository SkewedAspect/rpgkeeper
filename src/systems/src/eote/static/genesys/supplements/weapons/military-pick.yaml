name: Military Pick
description: Military picks have a superficial resemblance to mining picks, but they are usually smaller, and only a
  single spike protrudes from the head. As the knights of the Daqan Baronies increasingly began to wear plate mail and
  breastplates, blacksmiths started crafting these weapons to give opponents a way to punch through their heavy armor.
  Needless to say, many members of the nobility consider these weapons a "cheat," designed to give commoners an
  underhanded way to murder their betters.
