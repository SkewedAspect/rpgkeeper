name: Deflector Buckler
description: "Deflector cuffs produce a deflector buckler by generating a variable-frequency energy shield in a small
  circle centered on the wearer's wrist. The shield can successfully deflect high-energy projectiles and beams, although
  it has a harder time stopping comparatively slow-moving attacks like those made with most melee weapons. The edge of
  the shield can also deliver nasty burns and gashes to those hit by it. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural
  Manufacturing Differences."
