name: Graviton Detonator
description: "Restricted due to its devastating nature, a graviton detonator uses complex machinery to create a
  short-lived pulse of gravitons in a localized area, drastically increasing the weight of everything nearby. The weapon
  itself collapses into a pellet of neutronium that then almost instantly decays, releasing a vicious (and deadly) burst
  of radiation. The Ensnare item quality of this weapon activates without spending <advantage></advantage>, affecting
  all targets within short range of the graviton detonator. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing
  Differences."
