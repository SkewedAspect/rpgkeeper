name: Auto-Rotary Gun
description: This is a multi-barrel machine gun, like a real-world Gatling or Maxim gun. However, rather than achieving
  its high rate of fire through hand cranking or recoil operation, the steampunk auto-rotary gun is driven by a steam
  engine. This results in a rather large and heavy weapon that consumes a voracious amount of ammunition and coal (which
  take some time to arrange before firing, represented by the Prepare quality). For obvious reasons, this weapon has the
  Auto-fire and Cumbersome qualities.
