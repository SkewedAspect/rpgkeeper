name: Deepwood Longbow
description: The longbows of the Latari Deepwood Archers are of little use to an amateur archer, for they take a great
  deal of strength and skill to use. However, in the hands of a strong and experienced archer, they are deadly weapons
  indeed. Their range and hitting power is greater than that of mundane bows, and their construction is so solid that
  warping and breaking is unheard of. While in a natural, open-air environment above ground, the Deepwood Longbow gains
  the Accurate item quality.
