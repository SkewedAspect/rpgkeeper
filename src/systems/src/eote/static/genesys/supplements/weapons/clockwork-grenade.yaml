name: Clockwork Grenade
description: Our steampunk take on the common hand grenade is a bulky canister containing a simple boiler heated by
  combining two chemicals. When the user vigorously cranks the device, the chemicals combine, generating ferocious heat.
  This builds a massive amount of steam pressure, giving the user has a few moments to throw the grenade before the
  canister fragments. The explosive pressure flings the metal shards in all directions at high velocity, and splatter
  from the chemicals may burn the targets as well (represented by the Burn quality). Because the whole device is
  horribly unstable, if the user generates <difficulty></difficulty> on the check, the device blows up in their hand,
  and they suffer an automatic hit dealing the weapon's base damage.
