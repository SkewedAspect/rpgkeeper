name: Particle Grenade
description: This grenade releases a blast of highly energized particles that disrupt the nervous systems of most
  organic creatures. For this sci-fi take on the classic stun grenade, we figured the particles have a potent enough
  effect to leave the target dazed even once they regain control of their body, represented by a higher Disorient rating
  in addition to Concussive.
