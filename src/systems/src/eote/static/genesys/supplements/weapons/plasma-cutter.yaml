name: Plasma Cutter
description: "Plasma cutters are powerful cutting tools designed for use in shipbuilding, spacecraft manufacturing,
  heavy fabrication, and other industrial applications. Powered by a lightweight electrical generator, these tools
  create a high-intensity electrical arc that makes thermal plasma by reacting with a stream of pressurized carrier gas
  (generally argon). The powerful plasma jet can cut or weld almost any metal or alloy, making it both versatile and
  indispensable. Many modern plasma cutters are designed to be portable and come with straps or purpose-built backpacks
  for carrying and storage. A standard unit consists of a power pack, a cutting head, an array of tips for different
  jobs, and a reinforced power cable. Like the HHI Neptune waterknife, many of these tools were repurposed by Lunar and
  Martian rebels into deadly melee weapons and used in ship boarding, hand-to-hand fighting, and for carving up
  bioroids. A plasma cutter requires two hands to wield. Models Include: HHI PX830 Portable Plasma Torch."
