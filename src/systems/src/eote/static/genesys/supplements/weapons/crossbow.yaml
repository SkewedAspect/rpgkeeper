name: Crossbow
description: Crossbows can never match the effectiveness of a wellcrafted bow in the hands of a talented archer, but
  they are simple to use and powerful. The strength of a crossbow's mechanism is represented by the Pierce quality. The
  downside of a crossbow is the additional time it takes to ready it for firing versus simply nocking an arrow, hence
  the Prepare quality.
