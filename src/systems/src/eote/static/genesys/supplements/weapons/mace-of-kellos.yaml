name: Mace of Kellos
description: Priests of Kellos once ordered the forging of a flanged mace. They performed a series of warlike rituals on
  the weapon and imbued it with the spirit of their god’s wrathful aspect. When the mace is hefted in anger, the head of
  the weapon bursts into flames that scorch the foe. The Mace of Kellos is a magic implement as per page 218 of the
  Genesys Core Rulebook, and allows your character to use it to cast spells using the Divine skill. When casting a spell
  using the Mace of Kellos, your character adds <boost></boost><boost></boost> to the check. In addition, when the
  spellcaster casts an Attack spell, adding the Fire, Close Combat, and Holy effects do not increase its difficulty.
