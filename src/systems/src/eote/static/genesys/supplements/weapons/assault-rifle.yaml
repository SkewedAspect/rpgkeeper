name: Assault Rifle
description: While clattering, hard-hitting assault rifles are ostensibly military weapons, they can and often do fall
  into the hands of gangs, crime syndicates, and insurgents. The assault rifle presented here is a basic AR- or
  AK-pattern rifle like those carried throughout the world. The Auto-Fire quality is the primary thing that separates
  these weapons from other types of rifles, although they can be fired on semiautomatic as well (your character may
  choose whether or not to use Auto-fire). Assault rifles do roughly the same damage as other "long guns." Many
  militaries make carbine versions of their assault rifles, such as the U.S. military's Colt M4. They're more compact
  than full-sized rifles and a bit easier to wield. Carbines change their range to medium, but decrease their
  encumbrance by one.
