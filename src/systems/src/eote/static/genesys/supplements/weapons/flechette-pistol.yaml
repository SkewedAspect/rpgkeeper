name: Flechette Pistol
description: The flechette pistol uses electromagnetic coils to fire bursts of tiny metal spears called flechettes.
  These benefit from significant penetrative power and can sometimes punch straight through an opponent (represented by
  the Pierce quality), but they don't have a great deal of stopping power (hence the lower damage). Since each shot is
  actually a burst of several flechettes, the low Crit rating and Vicious quality represent the high chance of internal
  damage.
