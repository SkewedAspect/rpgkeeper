name: Jug of Blessed Water
description: Water, when blessed or sanctified by holy individuals, can be an effective weapon against certain creatures
  of the night. When it comes in contact with the undead, it burns their flesh like a powerful acid. Otherwise, it can
  quench the thirst of an irreverent hunter. This weapon is only effective against undead creatures. Against all other
  targets, it should be treated as normal water.
