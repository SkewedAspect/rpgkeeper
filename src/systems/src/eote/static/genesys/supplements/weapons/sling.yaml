name: Sling
description: Basically a leather cup attached to two lengths of cord, a sling is dirt cheap and its ammunition (any
  roughly spherical rock) even more so. A sling is more likely to be carried by shepherds and street urchins than by
  seasoned warriors, but a few adventurers keep one tucked away in a pouch as a weapon of desperation. d or h cannot be
  spent to cause a sling to run out of ammo.
