description: "Whether crafted from wood, steel, or hide, shields are common among warriors of all cultures and skill
  levels for a simple reason: they keep you alive. The utility of a shield for blocking and parrying blows cannot be
  overstated, and thus shields are a staple of most ancient cultures. We represented these elements of a shield by
  giving it the Defensive and Deflection qualities. It also has the Knockdown quality, since nothing beats a shield for
  bowling someone off their feet. However, a shield can't be used to hit someone as easily as a sword or axe, hence the
  Inaccurate quality."
