name: Electric Truncheon
description: Electric truncheons are nasty, ostensibly non-lethal weapons designed for crowd control. Think of them as
  clubs that also shock their targets on contact. The Disorient quality reflects the truncheon's electrical charge. The
  charge is not necessarily enough to be lethal, hence the Stun Damage quality (but a powerful shock can still kill
  someone, so the weapon has a Critical rating).
