name: Blazer Rifle
description: "The largest blazers tend to be bulky, snub-nosed carbines with a bit more range and power then blazer
  pistols. These weapons are popular among pirates, criminal enforcers, and anyone else who relies on fear as a weapon.
  Most arms manufacturers have found it pointless to make any infrared beam weapons larger than this, since the
  inability to penetrate armor nullifies any minor damage boost. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural
  Manufacturing Differences."
