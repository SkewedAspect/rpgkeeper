name: Monoblade Knife
description: This is an age-old weapon with a futuristic twist, a knife given an impossibly sharp edge through materials
  sciences. This is just like the knife on page 91, except that this knife has a better Crit rating and the Pierce
  quality; it can cut through tough materials and is more likely to inflict deadly wounds. If you want to make a
  monoblade sword (or katana), up the damage to +3, give it the Defensive 1 quality, and multiply the price by 2.
