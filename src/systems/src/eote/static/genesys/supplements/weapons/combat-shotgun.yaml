name: Combat Shotgun
description: "Whereas civilian shotguns are built for sporting and hunting, these weapons are built for military use. A
  typical combat shotgun is a light, short-barreled, magazine-fed weapon used by government and prisec forces. Primarily
  chambered in 12- and 20-gauge, combat shotguns are select-fire weapons that can fire a single round, fire a three-shot
  burst, or empty an entire magazine with a pull of the trigger. A combat shotgun's major drawbacks are their savage
  kick and their nasty tendency to jam during automatic fire. The kick is easily contained by integrated smart recoil
  dampers, but even modern weapon development hasn't solved the jamming issue. Your Game Master may spend

  weapon cannot be fired. Clearing a jam requires a maneuver. Models Include: HHI Model 8, Cantor XK Jackhammer."
