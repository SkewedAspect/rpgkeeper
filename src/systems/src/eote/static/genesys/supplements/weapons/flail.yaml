id: genesys-weapon-flail
name: Flail
description: Another weapon that originated as a peasant's tool, a flail has a long, two-handed haft linked to a heavy
  striking head with a length of leather or chain. Although it hits hard, this implement makes a better grain thresher
  than a weapon. Still, farmers across Terrinoth may take up a flail when they have nothing better to wield.
