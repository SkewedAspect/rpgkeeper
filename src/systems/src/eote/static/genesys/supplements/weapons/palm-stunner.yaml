name: Palm Stunner
description: "A palm stunner is a small, inconspicuous item that delivers a powerful stunning jolt to a target on
  contact. Roughly one centimeter square and only a few millimeters thick, palm stunners are held in the palm and
  secured by a strap across the back of the hand. They are powered by a high-yield capacitor that dumps all of its
  charge on impact with a solid surface, then takes a couple of minutes to recharge off the integral micro-charger.
  Activated with a punch or an open-handed slap, palm stunners make for exceptional self-defense weapons. Models
  Include: Personal Defense Industries Stun-R 900, NEXT Palm Protector"
