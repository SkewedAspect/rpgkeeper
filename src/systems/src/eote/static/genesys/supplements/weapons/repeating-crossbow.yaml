name: Repeating Crossbow
description: Nobody is quite sure who first invented this outlandish weapon, but most are quick to blame it on the
  Gnomes. A repeating crossbow has two pairs of limbs and strings that allow it to fire multiple shots in rapid
  succession. However, the lengthy reloading time makes many warriors wonder if the overcomplicated mechanism is really
  worth the fuss.
