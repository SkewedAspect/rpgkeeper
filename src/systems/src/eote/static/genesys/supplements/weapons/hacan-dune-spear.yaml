name: Hacan Dune Spear
description: "[Table: Ranged Stats] A noble weapon of a bygone age, the Hacan dune spear is a long gyro-spear that has a
  highly sophisticated electromagnetic tube built into the shaft, allowing it to be used as a powerful ranged weapon.
  The gyros in the butt and haft help keep what would otherwise be an unwieldy weapon perfectly balanced for thrusting,
  stabbing, and shooting. The dune spear was only used by some of the Hacan trading clans, but as the Hacan spread
  across the galaxy, the iconic weapon came to be associated with the Hacan people as a whole. Traditionally, a Hacan
  was expected to craft their own dune spear and learn the complex arts of ferrocasting and electromagnetic smithing in
  the process; however, few Hacan today still remember these ancient arts. Most dune spears still in existence are
  centuries old, finely constructed with folded terridium alloys and decorated with polished ivory finishes and ruby
  inlays. But a few crafters still make dune spears and even teach the craft to those eager to learn. The dune spear may
  be used as either a Melee or as a Ranged (Heavy) weapon with the profiles listed in Table 2-3 (shown above). This
  weapon requires two hands to wield (in either configuration). This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural
