name: Laser Pistol
description: "The first mass-produced energy weapon to enter the market was a laser pistol—NEXT's PL840.a, to be
  exact—and laser pistols have been the most iconic energy weapon ever since. Popular with senior military brass,
  exotic-weapon collectors, and those who live or work in space, laser pistols are the latest word in self-defense
  sidearms. Using a high-capacity rechargeable power cell, laser pistols are semiautomatic weapons that produce a nearly
  invisible beam of searing, coherent light instead of firing a projectile. They are exceptionally accurate over short
  distances and are shockingly effective against unarmored and lightly armored opponents. Models Include: Argus 78P,
  NEXT PL1000 Blaster."
