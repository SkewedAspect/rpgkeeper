name: Assault Cannon
description: This is the evolution of modern day autocannons and heavy machine guns. It may or may not feature multiple
  rotating barrels, or use explosive or armor-piercing shells, but the end result is much the same, since we are
  assuming the explosive radius isn't enough to justify the Blast quality. Instead, the Pierce and Vicious qualities
  combine with high damage to make a weapon that's probably overkill against infantry and enough to threaten light
  vehicles.
