name: Meteop Launcher
description: Meteops are small, dome-shaped explosive devices that are, essentially, high-powered anti-personnel
  weapons. They are fired from bulky, single-shot launchers and are typically used to break up enemy formations or clear
  rooms and vehicles. The launchers themselves are heavy and awkward, which gives them the Cumbersome quality. The
  meteop munitions provide the raw damage, low Crit rating, and high Blast quality.
