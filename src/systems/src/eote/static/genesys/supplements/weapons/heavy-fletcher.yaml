name: Heavy Fletcher
description: "Heavy fletchers are designed to do one thing: destroy large groups of infantry. These huge smoothbore
  cannons are the largest flechette weapons produced, and they are rarely seen outside of military bases. They fire a
  250mm-canister round packed with thousands of 2mm NEXT flechettes, similar to those fired by standard fletchers. The
  canisters disintegrate upon firing, releasing the flechettes and tearing enemy formations to shreds in seconds. When
  using a heavy fletcher, your character may spend one fewer <advantage></advantage> to trigger the Blast quality
  (<advantage></advantage> if the attack is successful, or <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> if the attack
  fails). Models Include: NEXT HF10, Skorpios Suit-portable Needle Cannon."
