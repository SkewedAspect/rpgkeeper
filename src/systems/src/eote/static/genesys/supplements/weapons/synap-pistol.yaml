name: Synap Pistol
description: "Synap pistols, also known as Gandhi guns, are detuned energy weapons designed for detaining suspects
  without killing them. Using a low-powered \"tracking laser,\" these weapons fire off a bioelectric charge that
  disrupts a human or android's synapses and leaves them paralyzed or unconscious. Unfortunately, a small percentage of
  people hit with Synap pistols go into cardiac arrest due to the energy discharge, but the weapons still remain
  incredibly popular as a (mostly) non-lethal way to defend ones self and incapacitate suspects. Models Include: NEXT
  Syn-stun Pistol, Strelet Arms \"Incapacitator.\""
