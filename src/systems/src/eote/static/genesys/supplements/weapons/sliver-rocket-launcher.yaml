name: Sliver Rocket Launcher
description: A sliver rocket launcher is named for the appearance of its narrow, supersonic projectiles. Sliver rockets
  don't have an explosive payload, but their armor-piercing warheads are immensely effective against even the toughest
  vehicles. We've given the weapon Breach to account for the devastating effects of impact against both vehicles and
  flesh.
