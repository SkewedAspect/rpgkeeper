description: "Spears are perfect for fighting in tight formation, where soldiers can't swing a sword or axe without
  hitting one of their fellows. Thus, foot soldiers of the baronies tend to train with spear and shield in the art of
  forming a defensive wall of thrusting spear tips. Standard spears are too heavy to be wielded in one hand or thrown.
  \"Light\" spears (sometimes called javelins) on the other hand can be wielded one-handed and consist of a thick,
  four-foot-long wooden shaft topped by a heavy iron spearhead. These spears are also light enough to be thrown over
  short distances; the Orcs of the Broken Plains often use thrown spears to skewer their prey while hunting. Your
  character can thrust or stab with a light spear using the profile in 2-5: Melee Weapons, or they can throw one using
  the following profile: [Table: Thrown Stats]"
