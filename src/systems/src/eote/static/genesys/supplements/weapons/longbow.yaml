name: Longbow
description: The primitive appearance of the bow and longbow belies their effectiveness. In the hands of a skilled
  archer, a bow can volley arrows into targets quickly and at range. Nocking an arrow and drawing a bow takes virtually
  no time for a trained user, so we don't think bows need Prepare or any other qualities to reflect that. However, bows
  do require a certain innate skill and coordination to use, hence the Unwieldy quality.
