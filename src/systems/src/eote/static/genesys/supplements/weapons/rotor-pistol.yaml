name: Rotor Pistol
description: Something like the Gatling gun of the nineteenth century, a rotor pistol consists of a number of barrels
  that rotate rapidly in order to achieve a high rate of fire. Unlike a Gatling gun, though, a rotor pistol isn't hand
  cranked; it is fired with a pull of the trigger. This is achieved by means of a quartz-galvanite battery that
  unleashes a single strong pulse of electricity that sends the gun's mechanisms into motion. After firing, you have to
  not only completely reload the internal magazine of the pistol, but also replace the battery. The Limited Ammo quality
  doesn't mean a rotor pistol only holds one bullet, of course, but that a single burst of fire consumes all its
  ammunition.
