name: Submachine Gun
description: "Submachine guns (SMGs) use pistol-caliber ammunition and a high rate of fire to provide a whole lot of
  damage capacity in a small, easy-to-use package. They are popular among criminals, police, and special forces
  operators the world over. The SMG presented in II.4-1: Modern Weapons on page 166 is a typical 9mm weapon that might
  be used by a metropolitan police force or carried by a drug lord's bodyguard. It deals the same damage as a light
  pistol, since they share calibers. It can fire full auto, so it has the Auto-fire quality. Even when it doesn't fire
  on full auto, we imagine each \"shot\" is actually several bullets, and so we gave it a lower Critical rating to
  represent the sheer amount of lead it puts in the air."
