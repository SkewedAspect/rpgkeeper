description: We've given this grenade launcher a profile reflecting a standard grenade. If you use a different kind of
  grenade (such as the particle grenade), change the damage and Crit ratings accordingly, and add the relevant qualities
  (you wouldn't change the launcher's Limited Ammo quality, for instance). Although this weapon is similar to a
  modern-day grenade launcher, sophisticated targeting systems help the user fire at the right trajectory to hit even
  distant targets, hence the long range and Accurate quality.
