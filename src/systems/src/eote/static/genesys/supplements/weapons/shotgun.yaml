description: "When you really want to make an impression in a firefight, a shotgun is a great way to go. Pulling a
  pistol from a hidden pocket just doesn't have the same dramatic effect as, say, drawing a lever-action 10 gauge out of
  a box of roses in slow motion. The flat thump of the report, the muzzle flash, the shocking recoil, even the loud
  clack-clack noise of working a pump action make these weapons an assault on everyone's senses, and also is what makes
  them so popular in action movies! The stat line in II.4-1: Modern Armor is for a basic pump or semiautomatic hunting
  weapon with buckshot. Shotguns possess the Blast quality due to the cloud of shot they fire and the Knockdown quality
  due to the concussion of their blast (and, honestly, the Rule of Cool). The basic shotgun stat line also assumes a
  magazine-fed weapon. If you wanted to have a simple break-action single- or double-barreled shotgun, you would give
  the weapon the Limited Ammo quality. Sawed-off shotguns have their encumbrance reduced by two, and they gain the
  Inaccurate quality. If you really want to dress up a scene, a character wielding a shotgun could add <boost></boost>
  to any Coercion checks, especially if they rack the slide and glare menacingly at the target."
