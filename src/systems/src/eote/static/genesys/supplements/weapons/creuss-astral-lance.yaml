name: Creuss Astral Lance
description: "As rare as the armor Creuss wear, a Creuss astral lance is both exquisite and deadly. Molded from minerals
  formed in the swirling energies of these beings' dimension, this weapon glows with a delicate blue or green hue as
  wisps of energy curl across its surface. Due to its composition, the astral lance can phase through armor and hides to
  damage the internal organs of an opponent or, in some cases, breach the exterior of lightly armored vehicles. This
  weapon requires two hands to wield. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
