name: Spring-Fist
description: A spring-fist is essentially a clockwork pair of brass knuckles. At one end is a glove reinforced with
  metal banding. The rest of the spring-fist is a series of coilsprings connected to a sturdy framework that runs the
  length of your character's arm. When activated, it lets your character strike with bone-breaking force. However, the
  springs require time to retighten after each use, hence the Slow-Firing item quality The Slow-Firing quality does not
  stop your character from making unarmed attacks in the intervening rounds, but they do not benefit from the
  spring-fist's profile while doing so.
