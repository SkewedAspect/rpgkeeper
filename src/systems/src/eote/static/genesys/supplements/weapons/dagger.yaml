description: "Nearly everyone in Terrinoth carries a knife at their belt; it is a useful tool for any number of mundane
  tasks. Daggers, on the other hand, are designed purely for killing. Their thin, razor-sharp blades tend to be
  perfectly balanced so they can be thrown with the flick of a wrist just as easily as they can slit an unwary throat.
  Your character can stab or slash with a dagger using the profile in 2-5: Melee Weapons on page 94, or they can throw
  one using the following profile: [Table: Thrown Stats]"
