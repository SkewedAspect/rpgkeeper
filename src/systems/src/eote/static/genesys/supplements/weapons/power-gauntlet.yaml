name: Power Gauntlet
description: "Power gauntlets are intimidating weapons typically used by police forces and criminal enforcers. Basically
  the hand and forearm of an exosuit, a power gauntlet encases a wearer's arm to just below the forearm in heavy,
  articulated power armor. A rechargeable power pack provides ample power to a thick, energized alloy shield mounted
  over the knuckles that delivers a punishing kinetic attack with every punch. While they are considered \"less lethal\"
  weapons, it is easy to deal significant damage to a target without really trying. Models Include: Argus PowerFist
  Powered Gauntlet, Mars Manufacturing MX-01 Crusher."
