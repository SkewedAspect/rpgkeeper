name: Repeating Rifle
description: This profile covers any rifle that holds multiple cartridges. It could be bolt or lever action, and fed by
  an internal or external magazine, but these subtle differences don't affect the profile. It can't fire quickly enough
  to warrant the Auto-fire quality. However, you might describe an attack that deals significant damage or a Critical
  Injury as multiple bullets striking the target.
