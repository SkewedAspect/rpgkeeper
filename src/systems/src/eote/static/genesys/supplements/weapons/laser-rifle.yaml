name: Laser Rifle
description: "Laser rifles fall somewhere between assault rifles and mass drivers in the modern weapons market. More
  accurate than equivalent slugthrowers and more efficient than Gauss rifles, laser rifles are a compromise between the
  two. They are typically semiautomatic, although select-fire versions do exist, and they are most commonly used by
  assassins, sharpshooters, and support gunners. They produce lots of heat when fired, which makes their shots difficult
  to conceal or mask, but they more than make up for it with solid combat performance and ease of use. Although many
  organizations still use some variation of a slugthrower, laser rifles have become the iconic weapon of the U.S. Space
  Expeditionary Corps. Models Include: NEXT L12 Laser Rifle, Argus 180R"
