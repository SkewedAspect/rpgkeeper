name: Cestus
description: Some say that cestuses came from the fighting pits of the Torue Albes, where brawlers still bludgeon each
  other senseless to the delight of drunken spectators. Though these weapons are no match for a proper sword, some
  adventurers prefer these heavy leather gloves with iron-studded knuckles. A wellthrown punch can still break bones and
  lay out an opponent, and wearing a pair of cestus draws a lot less attention than carrying a naked blade.
