description: "The light pistol listing is for a basic, medium-caliber pistol: a 9 mm or .38 caliber weapon, for example.
  If you want, say, a .22 caliber pistol, you could reduce the damage by one and increase the Critical rating by one. If
  it's a cheap, disposable \"Saturday night special\" kind of gun, maybe give it a rank or two in the Inaccurate or
  Inferior qualities instead."
