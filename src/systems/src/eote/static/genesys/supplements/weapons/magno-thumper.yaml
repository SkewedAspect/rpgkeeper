name: Magno-Thumper
description: "Produced originally by the Yin Brotherhood, this highly concealable snub-nosed coilgun serves as a weapon
  of last resort. Small, even by pistol standards, the magno-thumper has a wide barrel and a sizable power reserve that
  allow it to fling a heavy slug with devastating results. Unfortunately, the tiny size of the weapon means that after
  that shot, it needs to be reloaded with a new slug and power pack. The cost of the reload is 10 aurei. This weapon may
  be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
