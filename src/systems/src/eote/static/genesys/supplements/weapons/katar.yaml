name: Katar
description: Most scholars agree that katars did not originate in Terrinoth. Their best guess is that these push daggers
  originally came from the jungles of Zanaga or far-off Al-Kalim, before the design found popularity among the rogues
  who haunt the back alleys of Orris, Riverwatch, and Nerekhall. The broad, stabbing blade and horizontal grip allow
  cutthroats to dispatch their victims with a burst of swift, powerful thrusts.
