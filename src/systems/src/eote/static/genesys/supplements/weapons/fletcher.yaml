name: Fletcher
description: "Fletchers are a modern, high-tech take on the tried-andtrue shotgun. About the size of a combat shotgun,
  fletchers are heavy, short-barreled weapons that fire canisters of 2mm NEXT flechettes. Upon firing, the canister
  disintegrates and unleashes hundreds of razor-sharp darts that tear through armor, flesh, and bone as if they were old
  rags. While popular in the military, the NAPD has deemed them too vicious for police work. However, plenty of orgcrime
  outfits prefer these weapons as an intimidating enforcement tool. Models Include: Strelet Arms FX09, NEXT XR11
  Shredder."
