name: Laser Pistol (Space Opera)
description: These weapons fire beams of energy, which is really all the explanation you need in a space opera setting.
  Unlike the laser weapons presented in the hard science fiction setting on page 175, we assume these weapons are
  sophisticated enough that diffusion over distance isn't a problem. We also decided that the focused beams of these
  weapons can easily punch holes in armor, hence the Pierce (or even Breach) quality.
