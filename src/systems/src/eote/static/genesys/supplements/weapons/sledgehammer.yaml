name: Sledgehammer
description: "The sledgehammer wouldn't be worth mentioning if it weren't for the Human First fanatics who turned it
  into a symbol and a weapon. During the first protests against android labor, rioters bludgeoned many bioroids and
  clones to death with simple tools, the sledgehammer being chief among them. For Human First, the symbolism was
  perfect. The sledgehammer is a tool representing a hard, honest day's work; it is a dangerous weapon; and best of all,
  it is impossible to regulate or outlaw. A sledgehammer requires two hands to wield. Models Include: Various models and
  homemade versions."
