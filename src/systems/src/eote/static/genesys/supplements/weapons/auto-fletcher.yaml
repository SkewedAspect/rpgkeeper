name: Auto-Fletcher
description: "Most fletcher pistols are semiautomatic and fire one dart with every pull of the trigger. A few
  more-expensive models are select-fire and marketed as machine pistols or light SMGs. These automatic weapons trade
  their accuracy for the ability to fill a space with darts rather than a single pinpoint strike. Their needles tend to
  have a bit less stopping power, a trade-off for being able to fire dozens a second. Models Include: Skorpios MP1
  Flechette Machine Pistol."
