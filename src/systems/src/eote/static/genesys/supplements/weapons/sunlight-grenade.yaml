name: Sunlight Grenade
description: There was no need for devices to mimic the effects of full daylight until the discovery that it is
  repugnant to those who haunt the night. Though sunlight grenades are difficult to create, these inventions have proven
  deadly to some things that science cannot explain. When a sunlight grenade explodes, until the end of the current
  round, it acts as direct sunlight on all characters within medium range. Characters in cover who have the Sunlight
  Sensitivity ability suffer 3 wounds and 6 strain instead of the ability's normal effects.
