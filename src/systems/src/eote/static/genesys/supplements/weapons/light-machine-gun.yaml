name: Light Machine Gun
description: "Though machine guns have largely been replaced by heavy fletchers in most modern militaries, they still
  see use in some prisec outfits and military groups in less-developed countries. Modern machine guns fire heavy,
  caseless slugs and typically come with gyro-stabilization units to help absorb their punishing recoil. They also rely
  on high thermovalent plastics and metal matrix composites to disperse the incredible heat that builds up with extended
  firing, meaning they keep shooting even when their barrels literally glow red. Models Include: Degtyarev
  Collective-Plant Kord 40.r 10mm, Springfield M20 Machine Gun"
