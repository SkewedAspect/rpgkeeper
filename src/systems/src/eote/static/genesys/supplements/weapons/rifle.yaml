description: "A rifle is any long-range, magazine-fed, semiautomatic weapon used for hunting, sporting, or combat. This
  category includes everything from small varmint rifles to antique battle rifles from the distant past to modern,
  high-end biggame and sniper rifles. A standard hunting or marksman rifle is a semiautomatic weapon about a meter and a
  half long and made of lightweight alloys and composites. Like shotguns, rifles are nominally sold for sport shooting
  or hunting, but since there aren't many opportunities for either in New Angeles (outside of a limited number of
  shooting ranges), most end up used by police sharpshooters and criminals. Of course, rich risties may also own antique
  or even artistic pieces, with furniture carved from exotic woods or precious minerals. These rifles can be incredibly
  valuable, and even become a target for heists. Models Include: Gewehrwerks AG GR14, Skorpios Model 14 Police Marksman
  Rifle."
