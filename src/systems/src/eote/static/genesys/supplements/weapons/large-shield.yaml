name: Large Shield
description: The shape and design of shields varies wildly from culture to culture. The warriors of Al-Kalim prefer
  light, round shields of bronze, while the barbarians of Isheim wield wooden shields covered in tough hide. The knights
  of Terrinoth, of course, use shields crafted from iron or steel, often emblazoned with their barony's heraldry.
  Whatever their shape or material, shields can deflect arrows or blades and, in a pinch, can be used to bash a foe's
  face in. Large shields are sturdier and heavier than standard ones, and provide more protection. The Dunwarr Dwarves
  use large shields exclusively (to the point of mocking anything smaller), and those baronies that can afford it often
  equip their companies of spearmen with large shields as well. Bulwark shields are quite huge, tall enough to protect
  knights from shoulder to shins and almost as wide as they are tall. They are particularly useful for protection from
  missile fire, allowing a warrior to close with archers while avoiding being peppered by arrows.
