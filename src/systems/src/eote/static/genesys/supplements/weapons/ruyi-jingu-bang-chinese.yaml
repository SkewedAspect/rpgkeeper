name: Ruyi Jingu Bang (Chinese)
description: "Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, is a warrior, shapeshifter, and trickster who stole immortality from the
  inhabitants of the Heavens (several times over), defied the Kings of Hell, and undertook a legendary journey to
  protect the monk Tang Sanzang from flesh-eating demons. Sun Wukong's arsenal of mythical artifacts is extensive, but
  his favored weapon is one as versatile as he is: the staff called Ruyi Jingu Bang. Given to him by the dragon-king Ao
  Kuang, this pillar of iron was used in ancient days as a measuring stick for the primordial sea. When he took
  possession of it, Sun Wukong found that it could be transformed in size, shrinking to fit behind his ear or stretching
  across vast distances, or even split into multiple copies of itself. Ruyi Jingu Bang recognizes a worthy user,
  emitting a glow when in the presence of such an individual; others cannot lift it, let alone wield it. When making a
  combat check using Ruyi Jingu Bang, your character may target any opponent within extreme range, increasing the
  difficulty of the check once for each range band beyond short range. As an action, your character may plant Ruyi Jingu
  in place and set its size at any silhouette from 0 to 6 and its encumbrance at any value from 1 to 1000, alter either
  of these values, or remove it."
