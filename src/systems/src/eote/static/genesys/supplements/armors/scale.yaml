name: Scale
description: Something of a compromise between leather and chainmail armor, scale armor consists of hundreds of tiny
  metal scales attached to a leather jerkin. It is easier to forge than chainmail, but the scales and the leather
  combined make the armor heavy and unwieldy. Many spear companies mustered by the Barons wear scale armor reinforced
  with greaves and a breastplate. The rattling of hundreds of scales is fairly noisy, so your character adds
  <setback></setback> to Stealth checks they make while wearing it.
