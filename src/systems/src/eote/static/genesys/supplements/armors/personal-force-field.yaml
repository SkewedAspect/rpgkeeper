name: Personal Force Field
description: Force fields are a mainstay of space opera sci-fi, although in many settings they are primarily or
  exclusively used to protect ships and other large targets. The sophisticated technology and high power draw mean that
  personal force fields are rare and expensive. Mechanically, a high defense is less predictable than soak, but has the
  potential to cause otherwise successful attacks to fail.
