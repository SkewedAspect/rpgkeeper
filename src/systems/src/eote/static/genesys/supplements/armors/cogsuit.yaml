name: Cogsuit
description: A cogsuit is a suit of makeshift armor assembled from scavenged armor plates and machine parts (which
  sometimes include cogs). Such armor is common among pirates and other riffraff. However, these days the name is also
  often used for specially made armor worn by adventurers and agents of the Imperial Crown. Units in the military use a
  variant of the cogsuit that provides equivalent protection but looks much more professional.
