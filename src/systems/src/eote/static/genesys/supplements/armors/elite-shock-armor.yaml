name: Elite Shock Armor
description: Elite shock armor is the kind of horribly effective, horribly expensive armor that governments and armies
  only give to their very best soldiers. These might be marines assigned to board enemy starships, commando raiders sent
  behind enemy lines on the most dangerous missions, or the elite bodyguards of powerful emperors and rulers. When
  wearing this armor, characters increase their Brawn by 1, to a maximum of 5 (this does increase their soak value) and
  count their encumbrance capacity as 10+Brawn. This armor is also environmentally sealed, meaning that it counts as a
  space suit (see the next page).
