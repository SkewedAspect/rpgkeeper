name: Space Suit
description: "Civilian space suits are designed for comfort and ease of mobility, as well as for survival in vacuum.
  They are generally made of a tough but flexible cloth with an internal gel-armor layer that dissipates impacts. The
  gel also instantly hardens when exposed to vacuum, which means the suit has self-sealing capabilities against small
  breaches. Mag-boots and a limited-mobility pack complete the setup, and the whole outfit is light and small enough
  that it can be worn by fighter pilots, spacewalking construction workers, or passengers whose ship has suffered a
  catastrophic decompression. A space suit has enough air, water, and power to keep your character alive in vacuum for
  up to three days. The limited-mobility pack and mag-boots allow your character to move in zero-gravity environments
  without treating them as difficult and impassable terrain. This armor may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing
  Differences."
