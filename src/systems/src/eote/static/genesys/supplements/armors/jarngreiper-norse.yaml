name: Jarngreiper (Norse)
description: The dwarves forged these iron gauntlets for Thor so that he would have the strength to wield his hammer one
  handed. Even by themselves, the gauntlets can make the wearer into a fearsome weapon, greatly increasing the
  individual's arm and grip strength, as well as protecting their hands and forearms from harm. While wearing
  Jarngreiper, your character increases their Brawn by two, to a maximum of 6.
