name: Optical Camouflage Suit
description: "Rare and expensive, optical camouflage suits are wonders of modern stealth technology. Known colloquially
  as \"invisibility cloaks,\" these suits combine a sophisticated holographic imaging suite, sound baffles, and
  radiation shielding to make the wearer incredibly hard to see or pick up on sensors. The holographic imagers project a
  composite image of the wearer's surroundings on the suit, allowing them to blend into the background, while the other
  systems muffle noises and hide the wearer's body heat. Someone trying to spot your character upgrades the difficulty
  of their check once if your character is wearing an active optical camouflage suit. Models Include: ProTek Chameleon,
  Argus Mk II Infiltrator Suit, U.S. Army Model 30 Active Camouflage Suit."
