id: genesys-armor-brigandine
name: Brigandine
description: Many bards, rogues, and nobles in Terrinoth prefer brigandine armor, which consists of small iron or steel
  plates riveted between two layers of fabric. The resulting armor looks like a bulky tunic, but it can absorb or
  deflect blows better than boiled leather. The fabric can be embroidered or decorated, which appeals to the vanity of
  many in the nobility (and quite a few scoundrels and rogues as well).
