name: Echo Garment
description: "Any garment can receive an echo treatment, which toughens the clothing without relying on bulky materials
  or armor plates. The treatment coats fabrics with flexible polymers that bond with and strengthen clothing fibers at a
  molecular level. The process is an effective means of providing some basic, but discreet, virtually invisible
  protection. This armor may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
