name: Aegis (Greek)
description: "The Aegis is the armor of the gods: a skin of golden scales worn off one shoulder, with the head of a
  Gorgon attached to the front. While the Gorgon's severed head no longer turns those who look at it into stone, it does
  strike fear into enemies and inspire courage in allies. While wearing the Aegis, your character and any allies within
  medium range add <success></success> to any discipline and leadership checks they make. Any enemies within medium
  range must make a <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>
  at the start of their next turn as an incidental. If they fail, they are immobilized until the end of the round, plus
  one additional round per <despair></despair>. If they succeed, they do not need to make this check again. (If your
  group is using the Fear rules found on page 243 of the Core Rulebook, this can be a fear check instead.)"
