name: Admiral Arthur's Astounding Amplimotive Armor
description: This is a large, heavy suit of armor. The thick metal plating completely covers the wearer, although the
  helmet may be easily removable or have a hinged faceplate. This armor provides the best protection possible short of
  an actual tank, but it is far too heavy for anyone to support. That's where Admiral Arthur Schilling's patented
  steampowered amplimotive architecture comes in. By way of a complex system of gears and hydraulics, the armor responds
  to and enhances each movement by the wearer. A character wearing this armor increases both their silhouette and Brawn
  by one. (This does increase your character's soak accordingly.)
