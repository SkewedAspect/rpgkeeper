name: Covert Armored Skin
description: "This skintight body armor operates by bending light around the wearer, masking both bioelectric fields and
  heat signatures. Microscopic light/wave deflectors turn the wearer into a shimmering blur, and more advanced models
  even contain active auditory baffler systems that turn loud screams into muffled whispers. The only drawback is the
  scant armored protection, meaning the wearer's best defense is to not get hit in the first place. While wearing covert
  armored skin, your character adds <success></success><success></success> to the results of Stealth checks they make
  and adds <setback></setback><setback></setback> to any Perception or Vigilance checks other characters make to find or
  notice them. This armor may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
