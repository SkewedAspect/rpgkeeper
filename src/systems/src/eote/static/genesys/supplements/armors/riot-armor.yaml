name: Riot Armor
description: A staple of police departments the world over, riot armor is designed to protect from stones, bottles,
  shrapnel, and small-arms fire. The suit includes a helmet with eye protection and a large polycarbonate shield for
  deflecting blows and pushing crowds. We represent this with the higher defense and moderate soak, since the armor
  deflects hits better than it stops bullets. Your character must use one hand to carry the riot shield. If they do not,
  the armor's defense drops to 1.
