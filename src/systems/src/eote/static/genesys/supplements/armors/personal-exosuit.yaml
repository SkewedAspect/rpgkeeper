description: "Exosuits are powered exoskeletons wrapped in heavy composite armor and fitted with vehicle-class weapons
  that turn an individual soldier into a one-person tank squadron. That's how exosuit manufacturers like to describe
  their products, at any rate. While \"one-person tank squadron\" might be ad-agency hyperbole, exosuits are still
  exceptionally powerful pieces of battlefield equipment. While some exosuits are large enough to qualify as small,
  bipedal vehicles, many are smaller and designed to be armor that is worn, rather than piloted. The exoskeletons are
  adjustable for fit and are typically composed of myomer synthetic muscle fibers and nanohydraulics wrapped around a
  buckyweave-reinforced composite frame. Powered by high-output twelve-hour battery packs—themselves tended by a kinetic
  capture regenerative charging system— the frame increases a wearer's strength and durability. Their composite armor
  plates can shrug off nearly all small arms fire, and they are fully environmentally sealed. Wearing an exosuit
  increases the wearer's Brawn by 1 (this bonus also increases the wearer's soak, but it is not included in the soak
  increase in 2-5: Clothing and Armor) and the wearer's wound threshold by 4. The suit's sensor suite removes
  <setback></setback><setback></setback> from any Perception, Vigilance, or combat skill checks caused by concealment
  (darkness, smoke, and intervening terrain) that your character makes. If an exosuit loses power or otherwise ceases to
  function, its encumbrance value immediately becomes 12 and the wearer loses all the benefits of the sensor suite and
  the Brawn increase (including the additional soak from the higher Brawn). Getting into or out of an unpowered suit
  takes five minutes without assistance, or roughly two minutes with assistance. Models Include: Heliodyne Sampson
  Infantry Suit, Weyland Consortium \"Roughneck\" Heavy Labor Exosuit, Argus \"Ranger\" Mk IV Reconnaissance Exo."
