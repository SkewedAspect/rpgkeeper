name: Green Armor (Breton)
description: Worn by the Green Knight of Arthurian legend, the Green Armor is a suit of heavy plate mail forged from
  some unidentifiable deep-green metal. The armor makes the wearer effectively immortal and invulnerable. It is said
  that some wearers can even lose their head or limb, pick it up, and effortlessly reattach it. While wearing the Green
  Armor, Critical Injuries cannot be inflicted on your character. In addition, whenever your character would suffer
  wounds, they suffer strain instead. If your character exceeds their strain threshold, they are not incapacitated.
  However, they must concede victory to the enemy combatant and leave the encounter as quickly as possible.
