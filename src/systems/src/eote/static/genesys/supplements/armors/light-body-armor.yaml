name: Light Body Armor
description: "Light body armor is a catchall term for a collection of armored vests, flak jackets, and other
  lightweight, noncarapace, nonmilitary armor. It provides basic protection to the torso and often to forearms and
  shins, and it is typically paired with a simple, open-faced helmet to protect the head. Primitive and cheap—and often
  cheaply made—light body armor is rarely, if ever, worn by combat troops or mercenaries. Its primary users are
  civilians in war zones, criminals, and security personnel on a budget. Some athletes in particularly dangerous sports,
  such as hopper racing or snowboarding, wear stylized variants of light body armor. Models Include: OV-1 Bulletproof
  Vest."
