name: Periclis Suit
description: "Several species must wear armored suits to interact or even survive in the wider galaxy. The Creuss,
  Hylar, and Gashlai are all well-known for needing environmental protections in an oxygen atmosphere, but there are
  dozens of other species as well. Since each species has its own unique physiology and environmental requirements, this
  protection is inevitably produced on each species' homeworld. However, in the last decade, several noted armorers who
  have set up shop on Mecatol Rex have begun producing bespoke environmental protection gear for these species. The most
  popular is the Periclis suit, produced by the Herbedar Cooperative. Each must be made to individual specifications and
  thus is horrendously expensive, but anyone who owns a Periclis suit agrees that the results are worth it. A Periclis
  suit must be crafted to the exact specifications of the wearer, a process that generally takes two weeks. Each suit
  allows the wearer to survive in nearly any environment, including water and swimming and in vacuum, indefinitely (the
  suit includes nutrient recyclers that help keep the wearer alive, although the sustenance they provide is not
  particularly enjoyable). Note that these suits are not bulky enough to impose additional <setback></setback> on
  certain checks. In addition, because each suit must be made to order, the Herbedar Cooperative does not like spending
  time and resources making them for species who can survive perfectly well in oxygen/nitrogen atmospheres. For any
  character who is not a Gashlai, water-breathing Hylar, or Creuss, the cost of the suit doubles (to 4,000 aurei) and
  the time to construct it increases to 6 weeks. This armor may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing
