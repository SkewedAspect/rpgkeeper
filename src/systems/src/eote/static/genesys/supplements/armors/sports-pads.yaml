name: Sports Pads
description: The various shoulder, chest, arm, groin, and leg protection used in pre apocalypse sports can, in a pinch,
  make decent armor. Sports pads are often paired with heavy clothing, but just as often are accessorized with spikes,
  feathers, and motorcycle boots. The combination of shock absorbers and hard pads gives this armor both defense and
  soak.
