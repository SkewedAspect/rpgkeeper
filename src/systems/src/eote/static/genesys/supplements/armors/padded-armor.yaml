name: Padded Armor
description: Padded armor consists of thick, quilted layers of cloth, and resembles a winter coat more than a piece of
  armor. However, the thick padding can blunt blows and offer some protection for the wearer. Padded armor is most
  common in the northern realms of Isheim and in Daqan's poorest baronies, where warriors can afford little better.
