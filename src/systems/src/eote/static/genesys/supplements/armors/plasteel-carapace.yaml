  composite armor plates over a reinforced unisuit, this armor is the go-to for high-end prisec outfits and the U.S.
  military. Carapace protects against most small arms, energy weapons, and even shrapnel splinters and low-yield
  explosives. Some suits are environmentally sealed to protect the wearer against nuclear, biological, and chemical
  agents. As these suits are military hardware, there are a number of regulations against civilians purchasing and
  wearing them (which doesn't stop most orgcrime outfits in the slightest). Models Include: AMR Defense \"Crusader\"
  Infantry Armor, Garda \"Hussar\" Hardsuit."
