name: Bulwark Plate
description: "Some militaries train and equip units for defensive combat, while others (such as the Xxcha Companion
  Guard) fight slowly and methodically even when on the offense. These units tend to be equipped with armor colloquially
  known as bulwark plate. The armor is very heavy and thick, even compared to that of powered elite shock suits. Bulwark
  plate is inevitably powered, but even so, it keeps the wearer from moving faster than a walk, as its strength
  enhancers simply compensate for the armor's sheer mass. But it also allows the wearer to shrug off any attacks not
  designed to take out tanks. While wearing bulwark plate, your character may only perform one maneuver on their turn.
  The armor is very bulky and imposes <setback></setback><setback></setback> on Athletics, Coordination, and Stealth
  checks. This armor may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
