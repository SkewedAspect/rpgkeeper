name: Ghillie Suit
description: Ghillie suits are simple camouflage suits that conceal snipers and forward observers. A suit is little more
  than a baggy shirt and pair of trousers covered in countless strips of fabric, clumps of grass, and other detritus.
  Since ghillie suits are designed to obscure rather than protect, they have a single point of defense but no soak.
  Characters trying to spot someone wearing a ghillie suit upgrade the difficulty of their check once.
