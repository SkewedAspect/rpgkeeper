name: Optical Camo Suit
description: An optical camo suit plays with the idea that holographic projectors and other similar technologies will,
  in the future, allow people to wear armor that "cloaks" them and makes them invisible to the naked eye. Our optical
  camo suit doesn't quite go that far, but it does use holoprojectors to blur and obscure the wearer, making them much
  harder to hit (hence the defense value). Unfortunately, the complicated projector tech doesn't do much if someone
  manages to land a lucky blow, which is why this armor has no soak value.
