description: "Visible body armor isn't exactly what most people wear while strolling down the slidewalks of New Angeles.
  Well-heeled New Angelinos who are looking for a bit of protection often wear stylish clothing reinforced with a
  concealed layer of buckyweave and energy-dispersion fiber mesh to provide basic protection from small arms and light
  energy weapons. Just about any type of clothing can be tailored with this reinforcing layer, and quite a few shops are
  willing to discreetly add it to the clothes they already sell—for a substantial fee. Concealed buckyweave clothing
  looks like normal clothing. Anyone searching your character adds <setback></setback><setback></setback> to any
  Perception checks they make to find the concealed buckyweave between the fabric layers. Models Include: Various
  models."
