description: "Durable clothing is exactly what it sounds like: sturdy, wellcrafted articles of clothing that provide a
  bit of protection and can stand up to the wear and tear of modern life. These typical, workaday outfits worn by the
  majority of New Angelinos range from synthleather jackets and denim jeans to sturdy mechanics' coveralls and military
  surplus jumpsuits. While they won't stop a bullet or turn a monoblade, a suit of durable clothing is definitely better
  than nothing. Models Include: Various models."
