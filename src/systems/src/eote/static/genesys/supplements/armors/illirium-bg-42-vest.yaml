name: Illirium BG-42 Vest
description: One of the factors that has allowed the Union to match its supernatural foes in the field is the rare and
  powerful element known as Illirium. Illirium batteries power Union flash guns, and Illirium-reinforced armor vests not
  only can absorb bullets (hence the soak value), but can temporarily be energized to create a force field. When wearing
  a BG-42 vest, once per encounter as an incidental, your character may activate the force field to gain melee and
  ranged defense 2 until the end of their next turn.
