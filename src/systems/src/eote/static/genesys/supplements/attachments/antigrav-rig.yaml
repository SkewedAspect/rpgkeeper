name: Antigrav Rig
description: An antigrav rig allows its wearer to defy gravity in minor yet useful ways. While not powerful enough to
  provide the wearer with true flight, it allows them to leap great distances and slows their descent when they fall
  from a great height.
useWith: armor
modifiers: When wearing this armor, as a maneuver, your character may move to any point within short range, even
  vertically. Once per encounter, the antigrav rig can be activated to allow your character to leap to any point within
  medium range as a maneuver, or activated as an out-ofturn incidental to reduce your character's falling distance by
  two range bands.
