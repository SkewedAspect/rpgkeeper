name: Quick-Discharge Capacitors
description: Self-styled gunslingers prefer any modification that allows them to fire their weapon more rapidly, even if
  accuracy suffers. Adding extra capacitors that can release stored energy in a single burst adds to the weight of a
  shot but can disrupt the weapon's circuitry.
useWith: weapon
modifiers: When your character makes their first combat check with this weapon in an encounter, add Success Despair to
  the results.
