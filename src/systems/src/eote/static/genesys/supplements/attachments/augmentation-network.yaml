name: Augmentation Network
description: These rigs are installed in heavier armor and monitor the wearer's physical and psychological condition.
  They use electrochemical stimulants that make the wearer more alert and heighten their reflexes. The rig is not
  without drawbacks; soldiers who use an augmentation network become impatient and unfocused, and they often suffer
  profound exhaustion after use.
useWith: armor
