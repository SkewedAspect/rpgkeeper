name: Tripod Mount
description: Like a bipod, the tripod mount is a set of three folding legs that deploy from the center of the weapon to
  provide a stable stand to fire from. This kind of attachment makes sense for the weird war, modern day, science
  fiction, and space opera settings.
useWith: This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Heavy) or Gunnery weapon with an encumbrance of 4 or more.
modifiers: If the user spends two preparation to deploy the tripod, the weapon's Cumbersome or Unwieldy qualities are
  reduced by 3, to a minimum of 0, and the weapon's encumbrance is reduced by 4, to a minimum of 0. The weapon may not
  be moved (except to pivot on the tripod mount) once it has been set up. The user must spend two preparation to take
  the tripod down.
