name: Terror Enhancement
description: Making armor look more frightening has long been a tactic of most cultures in the galaxy. However, modern
  technology has allowed these theatrics to be taken to new heights. Simple paintings of blood or skulls (or another
  species' equivalent) on helmets or chest plates is just the beginning. True terror enhancements use holographics to
  create the effect of ominous lighting, subtle infrasonic projectors to create feelings of unease, and pheromone
  dispensers to affect species whose primary sense is smell.
