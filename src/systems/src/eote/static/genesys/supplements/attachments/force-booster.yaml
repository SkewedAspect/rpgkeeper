name: Force Booster
description: A force booster is a microthrust booster installed in a wrist mount connected to a hand-held tool. The
  booster activates when the tool is at the apex of its swing, maximizing the force of the strike. When applied to
  combat weapons, the results are no less impressive. Users must be careful, however, because they can swing too hard
  and injure themselves.
useWith: weapon
modifiers: The weapon's base damage increases by 2, and it gains the Vicious item quality or increases its existing
  Vicious quality by 1. When your character makes a combat check with this weapon, your GM may spend Despair Despair or
  Difficulty to cause your character to lose control of the weapon and have it land in a location of the GM's choice
  within medium range (if the check was successful, your character loses control of the weapon after hitting their
  target).
