name: Samaritan System
description: This attachment consists of an interwoven lattice of sensors and microtubes that stretch across the
  interior of the armor. The sensors monitor the wearer's vital signs. When the system detects that the wearer has lost
  consciousness, it releases a dose of dermal sealer at the point of injury. The system stores three doses of dermal
  sealer, which can be replenished from a standard dermal sealer device.
useWith: armor
modifiers: Once per encounter when wearing this armor, your character may administer one dose of dermal sealer to
  themself as an incidental. The wearer may even do this on their turn while incapacitated (this overrides the normal
  rules about not performing actions, maneuvers, or incidentals while incapacitated). After this system has administered
  three doses, it must be replenished, which requires three dermal sealers and five minutes of work.
