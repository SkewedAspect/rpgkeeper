name: Balanced Hilt
description: This attachment represents modifying a melee weapon's balance (particularly around the hilt or haft) to
  make it easier to control. This kind of attachment makes sense for any setting (even futuristic combat knives can
  benefit from being finely weighted or balanced).
useWith: This attachment can be applied to any weapons that use the Melee (Light) skill and to one-handed weapons that
  use the Melee skill.
modifiers: The weapon gains the Accurate quality, or increases any existing Accurate quality by 1. (If the weapon has
  the Inaccurate quality, it reduces that quality's rating by 1 to a minimum of 0, instead.)
hpRequired: 3
