description: "[Table: Bladed Defensive Weapon Stats] [Table: Blunt Offensive Weapon Stats] Combatants may need a
  close-quarters weapon one minute and a ranged weapon the next. Many have found ways to cause their weapon to change
  from one type of weapon to another. Some ranged weapons may be equipped with simple blades, but the most advanced of
  these variable-form weapons can actually re-form into a melee weapon at the wielder's command."
