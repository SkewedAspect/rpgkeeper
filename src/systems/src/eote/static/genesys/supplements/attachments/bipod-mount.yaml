name: Bipod Mount
description: A bipod (a folding, two-legged stand) can be attached to the barrel of a firearm. The legs stabilize the
  firearm and take up some of its weight. This kind of attachment makes sense for the weird war, modern day, science
  fiction, and space opera settings.
useWith: This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Heavy) or Gunnery weapon.
modifiers: If the user spends one preperation to deploy the bipod, the weapon's Cumbersome or Unwieldy qualities are
  reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0, and the weapon's encumbrance is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0, while the user fires
  from a crouched or prone position (or can brace the bipod against something solid).
