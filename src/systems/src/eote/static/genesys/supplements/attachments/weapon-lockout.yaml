name: Weapon Lockout
description: When installed in a smart-capable weapon, a lockout prevents anyone but the weapon's owner from using it.
  Most lockouts use a sophisticated combination of biometrics and palm-print sensors integrated into the grip.
useWith: weapon
modifiers: This weapon cannot be fired except by its designated user. Unlocking and reprogramming a stolen or otherwise
  "acquired" weapon with an active lockout requires your character to make a Daunting. Your GM may spend hhh or d from
  this check to permanently disable the locked weapon, rendering it useless.
