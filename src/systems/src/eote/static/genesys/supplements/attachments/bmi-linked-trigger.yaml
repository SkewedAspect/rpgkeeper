name: BMI-Linked Trigger
description: BMI-equipped runners are fond of saying that there's nothing faster than the speed of thought. Some
  mercenaries and pistols for hire apply this literally, getting a BMI linked to the firing mechanism of their weapon.
  Being able to fire a pistol with a mental command is faster than pulling the trigger, but it takes training to avoid
  doing so with a stray thought.
useWith: weapon
