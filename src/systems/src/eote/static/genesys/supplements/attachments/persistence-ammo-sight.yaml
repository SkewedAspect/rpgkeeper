  target they originally missed. Depending on the projectile fired, this maneuvering is performed via microdirectional
  fins, maneuvering verniers, or alteration of magnetic energy fields. Once a target is designated by the system's
  scope, any projectiles that miss their target circle back around to attempt a second strike.
