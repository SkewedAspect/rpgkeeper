name: Torso Combat Harness
description: Torso combat harnesses allow users to stabilize heavy weapons by supporting some of the weight with their
  own body. They consist of a harness worn by the user and attached to the weapon via a powered and articulated "arm."
  The whole arrangement is incredibly unwieldy for untrained users, but it lets someone carry a laser cannon while not
  wearing an exosuit.
useWith: weapon
modifiers: As long as the harness is attached to your character, the weapon's Cumbersome qualities are reduced by 4 to a
  minimum of 0, and the weapon's encumbrance is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0. The weapon gains the Unwieldy quality,
  or increases any existing Unwieldy quality by 1.
