name: Telescopic Sight
description: A telescopic sight magnifies a target, allowing the user to shoot targets that they could normally barely
  be able to see (futuristic versions may use special enhanced optics, rather than simple lenses). This kind of
  attachment makes sense for the weird war, modern day, science fiction, and space opera settings.
useWith: weapon
modifiers: The user reduces the difficulty of ranged combat checks made with this weapon at long and extreme range by 1.
