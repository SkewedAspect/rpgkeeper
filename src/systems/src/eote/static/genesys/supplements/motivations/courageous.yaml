name: Courageous
type: strength
description: Fear has no place in your character’s heart. They laugh at danger and gladly push themself to confront what
  others flee from. Note that your character probably still has a Fear Motivation. It’s up to you whether that Fear is
  the one thing that can undo your character’s courage, or if this Strength pushes them to confront the source of their
  Fear no matter what.
