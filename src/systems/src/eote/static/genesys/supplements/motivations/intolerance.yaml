name: Intolerance
type: flaw
description: For whatever reason, your character harbors some prejudices toward a group of people. These may be
  relatively "minor" biases, or they may give rise to an intense emotion of hatred or revulsion. Whatever form it takes,
  remember that intolerance is based more in emotion than rationality.
