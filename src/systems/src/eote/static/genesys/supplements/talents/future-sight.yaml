description: Your character must have allegiance to The Nomad to benefit from this talent. Once per session, after
  performing an action (and seeing the results of any check made as a part of that action), your character may use this
  talent to cancel the results of that action and perform a different action instead. (Narratively, the first action did
  not occur, and your character only performed the second action.)
