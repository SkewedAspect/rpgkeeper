description: If your character has at least one rank in a magic skill, once per encounter, they may use this talent to
  add <advantage></advantage> to the result their next social skill check. Additionally, this has a passive narrative
  effect; your character's appearance is subtly enhanced by their magic. Others do not note it as supernatural, but may
  be slightly put off. What form this enhancement takes is up to you, with your GM's approval, but it should be based on
  the magic skill your character possesses (as well as their backstory). A character with the Divine skill may always be
  flushed with good health, or their eyes may flash red momentarily. A character with the Primal skill may be surrounded
  by the scent of fresh pine, or their voice may have an intimidating growl. A character with the Arcana skill may have
  their hair tousled by undetectable winds, or when they wear a hat or hood, their face might be obscured by strangely
  deep shadows.
