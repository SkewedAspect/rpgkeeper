description: Your character must have purchased the Aethersprite talent to benefit from this talent. If your character
  made a successful Aethersprite check during the current encounter, your character may use this talent to make a
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>. If they succeed, they falsify a major
  distraction in the system. The particulars of the distraction are up to you and your GM, but they should be
  significant enough that any opponents ignore your characters and leave key installations unguarded or unlocked as they
  work furiously to deal with the distraction or flee for their lives. (Examples might include a major reactor meltdown,
  an enemy battlefleet entering local space, or poisonous nerve gas being leaked into the facility.) At your GM's
  discretion, certain actions that your character undertakes may cause opponents to attempt to deal with them, such as
  actively attacking an opponent or shouting that your character is the one who initiated the distraction.
