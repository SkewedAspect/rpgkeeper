description: "Once per encounter before making a combat check with a pistol (your GM has the final say on whether a
  weapon is a pistol or not), your character may use this talent to add the Auto-fire quality to the pistol when
  resolving the check. If your character does, the weapon runs out of ammo exactly as with an Out of Ammo result (see
  I.6-3: Spending Threat and Despair in Combat on page 104)."
