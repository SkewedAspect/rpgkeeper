  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> and choose one of their cybernetic
  implants that grants them one of the following: +1 to a characteristic rating, +1 rank to a skill, +1 rank of a ranked
  talent. If your character succeeds, until the end of the encounter, the chosen cybernetic instead provides +2 to the
  affected characteristic rating (to a maximum of 7), skill (to a maximum of 5), or ranked talent. Your GM may spend
  <difficulty></difficulty> or <despair></despair><despair></despair><despair></despair> from the check to have the

  several hours making an <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>."
