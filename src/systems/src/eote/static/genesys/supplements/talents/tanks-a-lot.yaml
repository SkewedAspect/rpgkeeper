description: When your character performs a combat check using a vehicle weapon, treat the silhouette of your target as
  one higher for purposes of determining the check's difficulty. In addition, your character can make Gunnery checks
  while they are engaged with an opponent; increase the difficulty by two, as if your character were using a two-handed
  ranged weapon.
