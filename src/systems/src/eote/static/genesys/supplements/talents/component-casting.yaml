description: When your character casts a spell, they may use this talent to consume a physical item and add
  <boost></boost> to the check. The item does not have to be expensive or rare, but it does have to be thematically
  appropriate for the spell, available to your character, and subject to your GM's approval. Some examples include a
  match or bit of sulphur for an Attack spell with the Burn quality, a piece of glass for a Predict spell, or a scrap of
  bandage for a Heal spell.
