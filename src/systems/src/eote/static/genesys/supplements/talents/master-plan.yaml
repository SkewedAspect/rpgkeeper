  close friend or ally who has positioned themselves to help your character at this exact moment. The details of which
  character turns out to be an ally depend on the type of encounter and your GM's approval. However, the ally could also
  have done their work beforehand, such as loading a squadron of drones with blank ammunition, shutting down power to a
  security system, or planting a tracer in an opponent's vehicle.
