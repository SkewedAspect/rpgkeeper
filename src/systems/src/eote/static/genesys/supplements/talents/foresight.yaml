name: Foresight
description: This talent costs 3 Æmber. Once per round, your character may consume 1 Æmber to use this talent to gain a
  glimpse of the future. When they do, add one temporary player Story Point to the player pool. A temporary Story Point
  works just like a normal Story Point but is removed from the pool when it is used, rather than being moved to the GM
  pool. Your character cannot use this talent if there is already a temporary Story Point in the player pool.
