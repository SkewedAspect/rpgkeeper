description: Once per encounter, you may spend a Story Point to have your character use this talent to target another
  character within hearing range. If your character knows the target's Flaw or Fear Motivation, the target must spend
  their next turn performing one action of your character's choice. If this occurs during a narrative encounter, this
  can be a single discrete task instead. At your GM's discretion, certain actions or tasks may be too unrealistic for
  the target to perform (such as harming themself or betraying a beloved family member). In addition, the target becomes
  more hostile toward your character in the future.
