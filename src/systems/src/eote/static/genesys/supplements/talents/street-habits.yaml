description: When you purchase this talent, your character gains Streetwise or Stealth (your choice) as a career skill.
  In addition, once per session while in an urban environment (usually when they aren't being watched closely), your
  character may freely acquire one small useful item that was not previously documented. The GM has final say as to what
  items can be acquired with Street Habits, but general the item should cost fewer than 100 Æmbits and have an
  encumbrance of 0 or 1.
