name: Backstab
description: Your character may use this talent to attack an unaware adversary using a Melee (Light) weapon. A Backstab
  is a melee attack, and follows the normal rules for performing a combat check (see page 101 of the Genesys Core
  Rulebook), using the character's Skulduggery skill instead of Melee (Light). If the check succeeds, each uncanceled
  <success></success> adds +2 damage (instead of the normal +1).
