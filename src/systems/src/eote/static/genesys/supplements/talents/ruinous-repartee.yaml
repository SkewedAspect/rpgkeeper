name: Ruinous Repartee
description: Once per encounter, your character may use this talent to make an opposed Charm or Coercion versus
  Discipline check targeting one character within medium range (or within earshot). If successful, the target suffers
  strain equal to twice your character's Presence, plus one additional strain per <success></success>. Your character
  heals strain equal to the strain inflicted. If incapacitated due to this talent, the target could flee the scene in
  shame, collapse in a dejected heap, or throw themself at your character in fury, depending on your GM and the nature
  of your character's witty barbs.
