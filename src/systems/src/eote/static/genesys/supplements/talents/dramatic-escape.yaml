name: Dramatic Escape
description: Once per session, your character may spend a Story Point to use this talent to escape from a dangerous,
  unpleasant, or awkward situation. The means by which they accomplish this, and where they escape to, should depend on
  the narrative, but your character takes no further part in the encounter or scene. After the encounter is complete or
  the situation is safe (as defined based on the situation), your character rejoins their companions via appropriate, if
  not necessarily plausible, means.
