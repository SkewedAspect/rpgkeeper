description: If your character does not make a combat check during their turn, they may use this talent to target one
  character (or minion group) within long range. That character must upgrade the difficulty of any ranged combat checks
  they make once until the end of your character's next turn. Your character may choose to affect one additional
  character for each additional rank of Suppressing Fire. Your character must be holding a ranged weapon to use this
  talent. Your GM can also rule that your character can't use this talent if they have no line of fire or range to the
  target.
