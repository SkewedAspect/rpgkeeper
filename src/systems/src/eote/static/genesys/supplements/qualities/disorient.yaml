name: Disorient
description: A weapon with Disorient can daze an opponent. When Disorient is triggered, one target hit by the attack is
  disoriented (see page 114) for a number of rounds equal to the weapon's Disorient rating. A disoriented target adds
  <setback></setback> to all skill checks they perform. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Disorient,
  the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.
