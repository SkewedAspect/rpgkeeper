id: genesys-quality-concussive
name: Concussive
description: The weapon's attack can leave the target shell-shocked from mighty blows or punishing shock waves, unable
  to perform any but the most basic actions. When Concussive is triggered, one target hit by the attack is staggered
  (see page 114) for a number of rounds equal to the weapon's Concussive rating. A staggered target cannot perform
  actions. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Concussive, the quality may be triggered multiple times,
  affecting a different target each time.
