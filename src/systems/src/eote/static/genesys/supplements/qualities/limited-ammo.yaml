name: Limited Ammo
description: Some weapons fire particularly large or complex projectiles that cost lots of money. Other weapons are
  expendable weapons like grenades that, once used, are destroyed. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality may be used to
  make a number of attacks equal to its Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with a maneuver. In addition,
  each shot expends one of a limited number of rounds of ammo; more ammo must be purchased or obtained before anyone
  fires the weapon again. This also applies to grenades and other "one-use" weapons that have the Limited Ammo 1 quality
  (here, your character is not "reloading" the grenade, but drawing another to use—mechanically, they are equivalent).
