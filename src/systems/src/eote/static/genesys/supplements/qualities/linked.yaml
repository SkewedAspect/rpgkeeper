name: Linked
description: Some weapons are designed to fire together at the same target (turrets housing multiple guns are a good
  example of this). When a character fires a linked weapon, on a successful attack, the weapon deals one hit. The
  wielder may spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> to gain an additional hit, and may do so a number of
  times equal to the weapon's Linked rating. Additional hits from the Linked weapon may only be applied against the
  original target. Each hit deals the weapon's base damage plus damage equal to the <success></success> scored on the
  check.
