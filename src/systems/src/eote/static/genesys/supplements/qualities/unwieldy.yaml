name: Unwieldy
description: An Unwieldy weapon is a weapon that can be particularly awkward to use for those without impressive
  dexterity and hand-eye coordination. To wield an Unwieldy weapon properly, the character needs an Agility
  characteristic equal to or greater than the weapon's Unwieldy rating. For each point of Agility by which the character
  is deficient, they must increase the difficulty of all checks made while using the weapon by one.
