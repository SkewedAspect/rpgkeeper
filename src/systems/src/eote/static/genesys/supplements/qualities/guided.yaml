name: Guided
description: A weapon with the Guided quality can track opponents. The Guided quality can only be triggered if an attack
  misses. If Guided is triggered, the controlling character may make a combat check at the end of the round as an
  out-of-turn incidental. The difficulty of this combat check is <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>;
  instead of building the ability of the pool normally, add <ability></ability> equal to the weapon's Guided rating. If
  the check is successful, the weapon strikes the target, and the attack is resolved normally. Guided requires
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> to activate, unless otherwise specified in the
  weapon's description. The Guided quality can activate on any subsequent combat check it makes, representing the
  projectile continuing to track the target.
