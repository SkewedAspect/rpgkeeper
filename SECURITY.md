# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only "supported" version of the software is what is running on 
https://rpgkeeper.com. The code running on the beta site, as well as the 
docker images, are not things that we provide any explicit support for.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please make a new issue with 
`[Security]` in the title. If you're concerned about disclosure, then
you can email development@skewedaspect.com with the title of 
`RPGKeeper Security Vulnerability`. Please be as detailed as possible.
