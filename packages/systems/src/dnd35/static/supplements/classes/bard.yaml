name: Bard
description: >-
  It is said that music has a special magic, and the bard proves that saying true. Wandering across the land, gathering
  lore, telling stories, working magic with his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience—such is the life of a
  bard. When chance or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards serve as diplomats, negotiators, messengers,
  scouts, and spies.


  A bard’s magic comes from the heart. If his heart is good, a bard brings hope and courage to the downtrodden and uses
  his tricks, music, and magic to thwart the schemes of evildoers. If the nobles of the land are corrupt, the good bard
  is an enemy of the state, cunningly evading capture and raising the spirits of the oppressed. But music can spring
  from an evil heart as well. Evil bards forego blatant violence in favor of manipulation, holding sway over the hearts
  and minds of others and taking what enraptured audiences “willingly” give.

  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: >-
      A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip.
      Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).


      Because the somatic components required for bard spells are relatively simple, a bard can cast bard spells while
      wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane
      spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the
      spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell
      failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.
  - name: Spells
    description: >-
      A bard casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards), which are drawn from the
      bard spell (page 181) list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or
      cleric must (see below). Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music).

      To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for
      0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a
      bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard’s Charisma modifier.


      Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In addition,
      he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When the table indicates that the bard gets 0
      spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st- level spells for a 2nd-level bard), he gains only the
      bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.


      The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells (also called
      cantrips) of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells. (Unlike spells per day, the
      number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers are fixed.)


      Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to
      learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for the
      new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two
      levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. For instance, upon reaching 5th level, a bard
      could trade a single 0-level spell (two spell levels below the highest-level bard spell he can cast, which is 2nd)
      for a different 0-level spell. At 8th level, he could trade in a single 0-level or 1st-level spell (since he now
      can cast 3rd-level bard spells) for a different spell of the same level. A bard may swap only a single spell at
      any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known
      for the level.


      As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time,
      assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. For example, at 1st level,
      Gimble the bard can cast two 0-level spells per day for being 1st level. However, he knows four 0-level spells:
      detect magic, ghost sound, light, and read magic. Thus, on any given day,he can cast some combination of those
      four spells a total of two times. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.
  - name: Bardic Knowledge
    description: >-
      A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards. He may
      make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see
      whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If
      the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)


      | DC | Type of Knowledge | Examples |

      |:--:|-------------------|----------|

      | 10 | Common, known by at least a substantial minority of the local population. | A local mayor’s reputation for
      drinking; common legends about a powerful place of mystery.|

      | 20 | Uncommon but available, known by only a few people in the area. | A local priest’s shady past; legends
      about a powerful Magic item. |

      | 25 | Obscure, known by few, hard to come by. | A knight’s family history; legends about a minor place of mystery
      or magic item |

      | 30 | Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by
      those who don’t understand the significance of the knowledge. | A mighty wizard’s childhood nickname; the history
      of a petty magic item. |


      A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its
      general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.
      The DM can determine the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table above.
  - name: Bardic Music
    description: >-
      Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him
      (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the
      descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting,
      singing lyrical songs, singing melodies (fa-la-la, and so forth), whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an
      instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a
      minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in
      at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.


      Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which
      means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that
      doesn’t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
      scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal
      component (see Components), a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails,
      the attempt still counts against his daily limit.


      _Countersong (Su)_: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical
      effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong,
      he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected
      by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack (such as a sound burst or command spell) may use the bard’s
      Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result
      proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstan-
      taneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it
      hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect
      against effects that don’t allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.


      _Fascinate (Sp)_: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more
      creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and
      hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction
      of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains
      beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability (two at 4th level, three at
      7th level, and so on).


      To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature’s Will
      save against the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature
      again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other
      actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level).
      While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks.
      Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw
      against a DC equal to the new Perform check result. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting
      a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. _Fascinate_ is an enchantment
      (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.


      _Inspire Courage (Su)_: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage
      in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be
      affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing
      and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear
      effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels
      thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting
      ability.


      _Inspire Competence (Su)_: A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music
      or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard.
      The bard must also be able to see the ally. Depending on the task that the ally has at hand, the bard may use his
      bardic music to lift the ally’s spirits, to help him or her focus mentally, or in some other way. The ally gets a
      +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard’s
      music. The DM may rule that certain uses of this ability are infeasible—chanting to make a rogue move more
      quietly, for example, is self-defeating. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2
      minutes. A bard can’t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.


      _Suggestion (Sp)_: A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as
      the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard’s
      concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.
      Making a suggestion doesn’t count against a bard’s daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw
      (DC 10 + 1/2 bard’s level + bard’s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature
      (but see mass suggestion, below). _Suggestion_ is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent
      ability.


      _Inspire Greatness (Su)_: A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or
      poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra
      fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a
      single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must
      sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds
      thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary
      hit points (apply the target’s Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on
      attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for
      determining the effect of spells such as sleep. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.


      _Song of Freedom (Sp)_: A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or
      poetics to create an effect equivalent to the _break enchantment_ spell (caster level equals the character’s bard
      level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a
      single target within 30 feet. A bard can’t use _song of freedom_ on himself.


      _Inspire Heroics (Su)_: A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or
      poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, allowing that creature
      to fight bravely even against over- whelming odds. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th,
      he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the
      bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus
      to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire
      heroics is a mind-affecting ability.


      _Mass Suggestion (Sp)_: This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher
      with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he
      has already fascinated (see above). _Mass suggestion_ is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting,
      language-dependent ability.
