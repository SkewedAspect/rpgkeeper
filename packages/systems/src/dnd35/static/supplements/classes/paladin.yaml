name: Paladin
description: The compassion to pursue good, the will to uphold law, and the power to defeat evil—these are the three
  weapons of the paladin. Few have the purity and devotion that it takes to walk the paladin’s path, but those few are
  rewarded with the power to protect, to heal, and to smite. In a land of scheming wizards, unholy priests, bloodthirsty
  dragons, and infernal fiends, the paladin is the final hope that cannot be extinguished.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and
      light), and with shields (except tower shields).
  - name: Aura of Good
    type: ex
    description: The power of a paladin’s aura of good (see the _detect good_ spell) is equal to her paladin level, just
      like the aura of a cleric of a good deity.
  - name: Detect Evil
    type: sp
    description: At will, a paladin can use _detect evil_, as the spell.
  - name: Smite Evil
    type: su
    description: >-
      Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if
      any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. For example, a 13th-level paladin
      armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+13 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses for high Strength or
      magical affects that would normally apply. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the
      smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.


      At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, to a
      maximum of five times per day at 20th level.
  - name: Divine Grace
    type: su
    description: At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.
  - name: Lay on Hands
    type: su
    description: >-
      Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of
      others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level × her
      Charisma bonus. For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can heal 21 points of damage per
      day. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn’t have to use it all at
      once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.


      Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on
      hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The
      paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead
      creature.
  - name: Aura of Courage
    type: su
    description: >-
      Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains
      a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.


      This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.
  - name: Divine Health
    type: ex
    description: At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases (such
      as mummy rot and lycanthropy).
  - name: Turn Undead
    type: su
    description: When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels
      lower would.
  - name: Spells
    description: >-
      Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells (the same type of
      spells available to the cleric, druid, and ranger), which are drawn from the paladin spell list.A paladin must
      choose and prepare her spells in advance.


      To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for
      1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a
      paladin’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin’s Wisdom modifier.


      Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In
      addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. When it indicates that the paladin
      gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level paladin), she gains
      only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not
      have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.


      A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to
      spontaneously cast a cure spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list,
      provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily
      meditation.


      Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her
      paladin level.
  - name: Special Mount
    type: sp
    description: >-
      Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve
      her in her crusade against evil (see the sidebar). This mount is usu- ally a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin)
      or a warpony (for a Small paladin).


      Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it
      resides. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may
      be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the
      paladin may release a particular mount from service (if it has grown too old to join her crusade, for instance).
      Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously.
      The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed )including barding, saddle,
      saddlebags, and the like). Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.


      Should the paladin’s mount die, it immediately disappears, leav- ing behind any equipment it was carrying. The
      paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first,
      even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty
      on attack and weapon damage rolls.
  - name: Remove Disease
    type: sp
    description: At 6th level, a paladin can produce a _remove disease_ effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use
      this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at
      12th, and so forth).
  - name: Code of Conduct
    description: A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an
      evil act. Additionally, a paladin’s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not
      lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for
      evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.
  - name: Associates
    description: While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly
      associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her
      moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.
