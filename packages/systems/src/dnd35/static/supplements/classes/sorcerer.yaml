name: Sorcerer
description: Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no
  books, no mentors, no theories—just raw power that they direct at will. Some sorcerers claim that the blood of dragons
  courses through their veins. That claim may even be true in some cases—it is common knowledge that certain powerful
  dragons can take humanoid form and even have humanoid lovers, and it’s difficult to prove that a given sorcerer does
  not have a dragon ancestor. It’s true that sorcerers often have striking good looks, usually with a touch of the
  exotic that hints at an unusual heritage. Others hold that the claim is either an unsubstantiated boast on the part of
  certain sorcerers or envious gossip on the part of those who lack the sorcerer’s gift.

  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
      Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer’s arcane gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components
      to fail.
  - name: Spells
    description: >-
      A sorcerer casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to bards and wizards), which are drawn primarily
      from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a
      wizard or a cleric must (see below).


      To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for
      0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a
      sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s Charisma modifier.


      Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In
      addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.


      A sorcerer’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells (also
      called cantrips) and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new
      spells, . (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the
      numbers are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can
      be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. For example, a sorcerer with a
      scroll or spellbook detailing an unusual sorcerer/wizard spell (one not on the sorcerer/wizard spell list in this
      book) could select that spell as one of his new spells for attaining a new level, provided that it is of the right
      spell level. The sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.


      Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer
      can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer “loses” the old spell in
      exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must
      be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. For instance, upon
      reaching 4th-level, a sorcerer could trade in a single 0-level spell (two spell levels below the highest-level
      sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 2nd) for a different 0-level spell. At 6th level, he could trade in a single
      0-level or 1st-level spell (since he now can cast 3rd-level sorcerer spells) for a different spell of the same
      level. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the
      spell at the same time that he gains news pells known for the level.


      Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at
      any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. For example, at 1st level, the
      sorcerer Hennet can cast four 1st-level spells per day—three for being 1st level However, he knows only two
      1st-level spells: _magic missile_ and _sleep_. Thus, on any given day, he can cast some combination of the two
      spells a total of four times. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.
  - name: Familiar
    description: >-
      A sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A
      familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature
      serves as a companion and servant.


      The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases
      in power.


      If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw.
      Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount.
      However, a sorcerer’s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar’s demise or
      dismissal. For example, suppose that Hennet is a 3rd-level sorcerer with 3,230 XP when his owl familiar is killed
      by a bugbear. Hennet makes a successful saving throw, so he loses 300 XP, dropping him below 3,000 XP and back to
      2nd level (see the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_ for rules for losing levels). A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be
      replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does
      not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.


      A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.
