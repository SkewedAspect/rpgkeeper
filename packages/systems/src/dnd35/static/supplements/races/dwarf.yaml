name: Dwarf
size: S
speed: 20
description: Dwarves are known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand physical and magical punishment,
  their knowledge of the earth’s secrets, their hard work, and their capacity for drinking ale. Their mysterious
  kingdoms, carved out from the insides of mountains, are renowned for the marvelous treasures that they produce as
  gifts or for trade.
traits:
  - name: Darkvision
    description: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like
      normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.
  - name: Stonecunning
    description: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding
      walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone
      ceilings, and the like. Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual
      stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were
      actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also
      intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Dwarves
      have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in
      their underground homes.
  - name: Weapon Familiarity
    description: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.
  - name: Stability
    description: Dwarves are exceptionally stable on their feet. A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist
      being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not
      standing firmly on the ground).
  - name: Resistant
    description: "+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison: Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins."
  - name: Innate Resistance
    description: "+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects: dwarves have an innate resistance
      to magic spells."
  - name: Common Enemy
    description: "+1 racial bonus to attack rolls against orcs (including half-orcs) and goblinoids (including goblins,
      hobgoblins, and bugbears): Dwarves are trained in the special combat techniques that allow them to fight their
      common enemies more effectively."
  - name: Giant Hunter
    description: "+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants):
      This bonus represents special training that dwarves undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous
      generations developed in their battles with giants. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to
      Armor Class, such as when it’s caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too. The _Monster Manual_ has
      information on which creatures are of the giant type."
  - name: Metalcunning
    description: "+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items: Dwarves are familiar with
      valuable items of all kinds, especially those made of stone or metal."
  - name: Artisan
    description: "+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal: Dwarves are especially capable with
      stonework and metalwork."
  - name: Automatic Languages
    description: Common and Dwarven.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon. Dwarves are familiar with the languages of their
      enemies and of their subterranean allies.
  - name: Favored Class
    description: Fighter. A multiclass dwarf’s fighter class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience
      point penalty for multiclassing. Dwarven culture extols the virtues of battle, and the vocation comes easily to
      dwarves.
