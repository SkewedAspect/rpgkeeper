name: Half-Elf
size: M
speed: 30
description: >-
  Humans and elves sometimes wed, the elf attracted to the human’s energy and the human to the elf’s grace. These
  marriages end quickly as elves count years because a human’s life is so brief, but they leave an enduring
  legacy—half-elf children.


  The life of a half-elf can be hard. If raised by elves, the half-elf seems to grow with astounding speed, reaching
  maturity within two decades. The half-elf becomes an adult long before she has had time to learn the intricacies of
  elven art and culture, or even grammar. She leaves behind her childhood friends, becoming physically an adult but
  culturally still a child by elven standards. Typically, she leaves her elven home, which is no longer familiar, and
  finds her way among humans.


  If, on the other hand, she is raised by humans, the half-elf finds herself different from her peers: more aloof, more
  sensitive, less ambitious, and slower to mature. Some half-elves try to fit in among humans, while others find their
  identities in their difference. Most find places for themselves in human lands, but some feel like outsiders all their
  lives.
traits:
  - name: Sleep Immunity
    description: Immunity to magic sleep effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.
  - name: Low-light Vision
    description: A half-elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of
      poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
  - name: Keen Senses
    description: "+1 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks: A half-elf does not have the elf’s ability to notice
      secret doors simply by passing near them. Half-elves have keen senses, but not as keen as those of an elf."
  - name: Natural Diplomat
    description: "+2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks: Half-elves get along naturally with all people."
  - name: Elven Blood
    description: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. Half-elves, for example, are just as
      vulnerable to special effects that affect elves as their elf ancestors are, and they can use magic items that are
      only usable by elves.
  - name: Automatic Languages
    description: Common and Elven.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic). Half-elves have all the versatility and broad (if
      shallow) experience that humans have.
  - name: Favored Class
    description: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience point penalty, her highest-level
      class does not count.
