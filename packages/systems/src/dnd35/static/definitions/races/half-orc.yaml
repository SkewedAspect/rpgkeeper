id: dnd35-race-half-orc
name: Half-Orc
size: M
speed: 30
description: In the wild frontiers, tribes of human and orc barbarians live in uneasy balance, fighting in times of war
  and trading in times of peace. Half-orcs who are born in the frontier may live with either human or orc parents, but
  they are nevertheless exposed to both cultures. Some, for whatever reason, leave their homeland and travel to
  civilized lands, bringing with them the tenacity, courage, and combat prowess that they developed in the wilds.
traits:
  - name: Darkvision
    description: Half-orcs (and orcs) can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is
      otherwise like normal sight, and half-orcs can function just fine with no light at all.
  - name: Orc Blood
    description: For all effects related to race, a half-orc is considered an orc. Half-orcs, for example, are just as
      vulnerable to special effects that affect orcs as their orc ancestors are, and they can use magic items that are
      only usable by orcs.
  - name: Automatic Languages
    description: Common and Orc.
  - name: Bonus Languages
    description: Draconic, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Abyssal. Smart half-orcs (who are rare) may know the languages of their
      allies or rivals.
  - name: Favored Class
    description: Barbarian. A multiclass half-orc’s barbarian class does not count when determining whether he takes an
      experience point penalty. Ferocity runs in a half-orc’s veins.
