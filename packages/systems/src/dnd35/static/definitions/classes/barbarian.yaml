name: Barbarian
description: From the frozen wastes of the north and the hellish jungles of the south come brave, even reckless,
  warriors. Civilized people call them barbarians or berserkers and suspect them of mayhem, impiety, and atrocities.
  These “barbarians,” however, have proven their mettle and their value to those who would be their allies. To enemies
  who underestimated them, they have proved their cunning, rereferencefulness, persistence, and mercilessness.
features:
  - name: Weapon and Armor Proficiency
    description: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields
      (except tower shields).
  - name: Fast Movement
    type: ex
    description: A barbarian’s land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when
      he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before
      modifying the barbarian’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. For example, a human barbarian has a
      speed of 40 feet, rather than 30 feet, when wearing light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a
      medium load, his speed drops to 30 feet. A halfling barbarian has a speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet, in
      light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 20 feet.
  - name: Illiteracy
    description: >-
      Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2
      skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.


      A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a
      barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.
  - name: Rage
    type: ex
    description: >-
      A barbarian can fly into a screaming blood frenzy a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian gains
      phenomenal strength and durability but becomes reckless and less able to defend himself. He temporarily gains a +4
      bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a –2 penalty to
      Armor Class.


      The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go
      away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost
      first the way temporary hit points are; see Temporary Hit Points) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any
      Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the
      Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate
      magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll)
      to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit
      of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A
      barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and
      restrictions and becomes fatigued (–2 penalty to Strength, –2 penalty to Dex- terity, can’t charge or run) for the
      duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer
      applies).


      A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At
      4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times
      per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action
      (see Initiative), not in response to someone else’s action. A barbarian can’t, for example, fly into a rage when
      struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution, although the extra
      hit points would be of benefit if he had gone into a rage earlier in the round, _before_ the arrow struck.
  - name: Uncanny Dodge
    type: ex
    description: >-
      At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do
      so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible
      attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.


      If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a barbarian with at least four levels of rogue,
      for example), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.
  - name: Trap Sense
    type: ex
    description: Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him
      a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These
      bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense
      bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
  - name: Improved Uncanny Dodge
    type: ex
    description: >-
      At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him
      as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the
      barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian
      levels.


      If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains
      improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the
      minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.
  - name: Damage Reduction
    type: ex
    description: At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack.
      Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At
      10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises
      by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
  - name: Greater Rage
    type: ex
    description: At 11th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and
      his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at –2.
  - name: Indomitable Will
    type: ex
    description: While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment
      spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives
      during his rage.
  - name: Tireless Rage
    type: ex
    description: At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.
  - name: Mighty Rage
    type: ex
    description: At 20th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and
      his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at –2.
