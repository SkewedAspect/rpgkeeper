name: Ammonia Breathers
description: One notable difference between the two main sub-species of Gand is that one had lungs and one does not.
  Those that have lungs breathe an ammonia gas mixture. Those without lungs do not respire and gain all necessary
  metabolic substances through food. When playing a Gand, each player chooses whether he wishes his character to have
  lungs or not. If he selects to be playing a lungless Gand, his character is immune to suffocation (but not the wounds
  suffered from being exposed to vacuum). If he chooses to play a gand with lungs, he starts the game with an ammonia
  respirator, and treats oxygen as a dangerous atmosphere with Rating 8. However, he gains +10 starting XP.
