name: Reflect
description: _Force talent_. When the character suffers a hit from a Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), or Gunnery combat
  check, and after damage is calculated (but before soak is applied, so immediately after step 3 of **Perform a Combat
  Check**, page 148), if the character is wielding a lightsaber, he may take the Reflect incidental. He suffers 3 strain
  and reduces the damage dealt by that hit from the attack by a number equal to two plus his ranks in Reflect. This
  talent may only be used when the character is wielding a Lightsaber weapon.
