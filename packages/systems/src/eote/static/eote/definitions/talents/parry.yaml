name: Parry
description: When the character suffers a hit from a Brawl, Melee, or Lightsaber combat check, after damage is
  calculated (but before soak is applied, so immediately after step 3 of *Perform a Combat Check*, page 148 F&D), the
  character may take a Parry incidental. He suffers 3 strain and reduces the damage dealt by that hit from the attack by
  a number equal to two plus his ranks in Parry. This talent may only be used when the character is wielding a
  Lightsaber or Melee weapon.
