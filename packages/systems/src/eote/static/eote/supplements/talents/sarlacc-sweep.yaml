name: Sarlacc Sweep
description: >-
  _Force Talent._ The character may take the Sarlacc Sweep action, making a Lightsaber combat check with a +1 difficulty
  against one engaged target. The character may spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> generated by this
  combat check to hit one additional target he is engaged with. He may do this once per engaged target, paying
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> for each additional hit.

  When performing a combat check while benefiting from the Sarlacc Sweep incidental, the character must always target
  the opponent with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses which
  target is the initial target).
