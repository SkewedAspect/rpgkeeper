description: Whenever a Trandoshan would recover one or more wounds from natural rest or recuperation in a Bacta tank,
  he recovers one additional wound. He does not recover one additional wound when receiving first aid or then using a
  stimpack. Trandoshans can regrow lost limbs as well, though it usually takes at least a month before the limb is
  usable.
