name: Saimoc Crystaledge Honing
description: Letnev forces have developed a process to grind up and bond saimoc crystals to the edges of bladed weapons.
  The microscopic honing process seeds an edge with millions of sharp, serrated points. The effectiveness of "saimoc
  honing" has spread to other cultures as well. The cost of the honing process is prohibitive, but for those who can
  afford it, the result is a fine, deadly blade that can carve through virtually anything or anyone.
useWith: This attachment can be used with any Melee weapon with a physical blade.
modifiers: The weapon gains the Vicious item quality or raises its existing Vicious by 2, and it gains the Sunder item quality.
