description: These rigs are installed in heavier armor and monitor the wearer's physical and psychological condition.
  They use electrochemical stimulants that make the wearer more alert and heighten their reflexes. The rig is not
  without drawbacks; soldiers who use an augmentation network become impatient and unfocused, and they often suffer
  profound exhaustion after use.
useWith: This attachment may be installed in any armor with a soak value of 2 or higher.
modifiers: When wearing this armor, as an incidental, your character may choose to add boost to Perception checks,
  Vigilance checks, and all combat checks for the remainder of the encounter and must add setback to all other checks
  until the end of the encounter. If they do so, at the end of the encounter they suffer 8 strain.
