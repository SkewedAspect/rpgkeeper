name: Telescopic Sight
description: A telescopic sight magnifies a target, allowing the user to shoot targets that they could normally barely
  be able to see (futuristic versions may use special enhanced optics, rather than simple lenses). This kind of
  attachment makes sense for the weird war, modern day, science fiction, and space opera settings.
useWith: This attachment can be applied to any ranged weapon that could logically benefit from the addition of a
  telescopic sight.
modifiers: The user reduces the difficulty of ranged combat checks made with this weapon at long and extreme range by 1.
