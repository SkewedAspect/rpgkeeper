name: Deflective Plating
description: This attachment applies angled plates or mildly reflective surfaces to help deflect incoming ranged
  attacks. This kind of attachment makes sense in fantasy, science fiction, and space opera settings (in the past, armor
  might be designed to deflect arrows or throwing knives, while in the future, it could reflect lasers or energy
  blasts).
useWith: This attachment can be applied to any armor.
modifiers: Wearer increases their ranged defense by 1.
hpRequired: 1
