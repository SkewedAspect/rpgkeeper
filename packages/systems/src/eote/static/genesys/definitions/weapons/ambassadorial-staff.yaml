name: Ambassadorial Staff
description: "A leftover tradition from the Lazax, wielding this ceremonial staff allows sentients on government or
  royal business to communicate their importance to others. This device is approximately two meters in length and is
  normally adorned with the wielder's symbol of office. Traditionally, the Lazax also built discreet electrostatic
  projectors into the staff, allowing their ambassadors to defend themselves in an emergency. While wielding an
  ambassadorial staff, a character adds <advantage></advantage> to any social skill checks they make as long as the
  target is a member of the Galactic Council or someone who recognizes their authority. If the target is neither, the
  character adds <despair></despair> to their social skill check instead. This weapon requires two hands to wield. This
  weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
