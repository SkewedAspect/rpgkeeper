name: Collapsible Blade
description: "Occasionally there is a need for a the keleres of the council to possess an easily accessible weapon while
  still engaging in delicate political investigations or negotiations. A collapsible blade looks like an unassuming cube
  of metal when not in use. However, when deployed, the cube quickly unfolds into a short, serviceable blade with a
  basic hilt. Your character must spend a maneuver to collapse their collapsible blade. While the blade is collapsed,
  those searching the character add <setback></setback> to any checks made to find the collapsible blade. This weapon
  may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
