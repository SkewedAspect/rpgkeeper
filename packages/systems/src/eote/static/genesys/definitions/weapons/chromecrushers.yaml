name: Chromecrushers
description: "These high-tech boxing gloves were originally invented for use in the new gladiatorial rings that sprang
  up after androids became commonplace. In shadowy, illegal establishments like Hoyo Rojo, stimmed-up humans pit
  themselves against bioroids as bets are placed on how long the androids can survive before being beaten into scrap.
  Chromecrushers have reduced that survival time considerably. These heavy gloves fit powerful burst-discharge actuators
  over the knuckles, amplifying the power of each punch several times over. Heavy power cables run to a small backpack
  power supply. The entire rig is light enough that it won't weigh a boxer down, but its bloody origins give this weapon
  (and its wielders) a dark reputation in civilized circles. Chromecrushers require two hands to wield (since they can
  only be used in pairs). Models Include: Kaluta Collective Hammerstryke!, Cyberclash Industries Punchmasters."
