name: Waterknife
description: 'Waterknives are heavy industrial cutting tools designed for precision work on heat-sensitive materials.
  Instead of a sharp blade or a jet of superheated plasma, waterknives use a high-pressure stream of abrasive blasting
  media suspended in a viscous liquid. The liquid lubricates and cools the materials being cut, and the blasting medium—
  typically subminiature quartz pellets or powdered synthetic diamond—does the actual cutting. Although many waterknives
  are so big and bulky that they need to be fixed in place, modern versions can be miniaturized enough to be carried
  around as a large and wet power saw. These portable versions are occasionally repurposed into ersatz and extremely
  vicious close-combat weapons. A waterknife requires two hands to wield. Models Include: HHI "Neptune" Hydro Suspension
  Cutting System.'
