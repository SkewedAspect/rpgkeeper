name: Micro-Missile Launcher
description: One thing we can expect in the future is the further miniaturization of computers, which leads us to the
  micromissile launcher. This portable weapon fires miniature missiles that lock onto a target, pursue it, and detonate.
  The tracking ability comes with the Guided quality (and the time to lock onto a target is represented by the Prepare
  quality). As with the Gauss Rifle, a weapon this powerful needs drawbacks to compensate, which are the weapon's high
  Cumbersome rating and encumbrance.
