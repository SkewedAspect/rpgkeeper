name: Mjolnir (Ranged) (Norse)
description: This hammer is so heavy that it would take a strong person two hands to swing, but the dwarves forging it
  were distracted by Loki and only made the shaft long enough for a single-hand grip. Thor himself can only wield the
  hammer in one hand thanks to the Jarngreiper gauntlets. When making a combat check using Mjolnir, your character
  increases the damage dealt by +2 per <success></success> (rather than by +1). When your character makes a ranged
  combat check with Mjolnir, they may spend aa or t to have it return to their hand at the beginning of their next turn.
