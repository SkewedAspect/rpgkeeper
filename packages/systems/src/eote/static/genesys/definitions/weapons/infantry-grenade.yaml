name: Infantry Grenade
description: "Standard infantry grenades are small explosive devices (often in the form of a sphere or disk for easy
  throwing). When thrown, they arm themselves automatically, detonating on contact with the target. Nearly all rely on
  some sort of supercompact explosive combined with microshrapnel and a blinding gas to disorient biological targets.
  This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
