name: Rotorsword
description: This heavy "sword" features a rotating, bladed chain that runs most of the length of the weapon. It is
  little more than a steam-powered chainsaw held like a two-handed sword. Although a rotorsword is extremely deadly, the
  impracticality of having to fuel it before battle has prevented it from becoming a mainstay of fighting forces.
  Additionally, bringing it to a gunfight is still risky We've given this grisly weapon the Vicious, Sunder, and Pierce
  qualities to represent the horrible damage its heavy rotating blade inflicts. To represent the weight and
  impracticality of the weapon, we've added Inaccurate and Cumbersome. Rotorswords require two hands to wield (and use
  the Melee (Heavy) skill if in settings that include that skill).
