description: "Monoblades are clever, easily concealed weapons that are among the most deadly devices ever created. Built
  in various lengths and styles, monoblades feature a simple knife or sword hilt that contains a reel of retractable
  blade media, a static generator, and a powerful capacitor. The reel contains a set length of buckyweave a single
  molecule thick that, when charged by the static generator in the hilt, stiffens into a wickedly sharp blade.
  Monoblades can cut through cloth, armor, flesh, and bone with equal ease and are extremely dangerous in the right
  hands. Models Include: Strelet Arms Razor Edge, Delta Arms M30 Utility Blade."
