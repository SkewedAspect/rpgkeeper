name: Sniper Rifle
description: While they vary by service and country, all sniper rifles are designed to fire high-caliber, high-velocity
  rounds over long distances. The sniper rifle entry here is a basic dedicated sniper rifle like the U.S. Army's M24
  rifle. The range is extreme to represent its ability to reach farther than even regular hunting rifles. Sniper rifles
  possess the Accurate and Pierce qualities to reflect their excellent balance and specialized rounds. They do, however,
  have a smaller magazine, hence the Limited Ammo quality.
