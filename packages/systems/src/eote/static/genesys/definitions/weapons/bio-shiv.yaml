name: Bio-Shiv
description: "Originally designed by the Yssaril Tribes and created from its owner's DNA, the bio-shiv consists of
  genetic material spliced with flexible polymers that give it the appearance of a thin, bonelike lattice. The weapon is
  normally \"sheathed\" in a specially created pocket along the wearer's arm or leg. While within the wearer's body, the
  material is as flexible as any tissue and cannot be detected on most scanners. Even the pocket appears to be an old
  scar. However, when drawn, the weapon hardens into a sharp, thin knife. The shiv can even be \"resheathed\" (albeit a
  painful process), and as it is reinserted into the skin, it returns to its malleable state While the bio-shiv is
  sheathed, those searching the character add <failure></failure><failure></failure><failure></failure> to the results
  of any checks made to find the bio-shiv. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
