name: Maser
description: "Masers—also known as microwave lasers—emit nearly invisible beams of focused microwaves instead of
  visible-spectrum light. Masers can be tuned to excite water molecules in their targets; this can't hurt targets in
  metallic armor but is utterly lethal to everyone else. Originally used for long-range, high-output communications and
  specialized industrial uses (such as \"baking\" lunar rocks to vaporize and release water molecules trapped inside),
  many were converted into weapons during the Lunar Insurrection. Most domes and fortified bunkers were constructed of a
  combination of composites and pressed lunar rock, both of which allow focused microwaves to pass right through. Since
  the Insurrection, purpose-built maser weapons have been produced in small numbers by NEXT for military use. While
  still not as efficient or accurate as a laser, masers are nevertheless extremely deadly short-range anti-personnel
  weapons. While they can't penetrate sheets of metal, they do tend to short out unshielded electronics. When your
  character makes a combat check with a maser against a target that is covered or primarily composed of metal (what
  armor falls into this category is up to your GM, but generally should include plasteel carapace and exosuits), the
  maser loses the Breach item quality for the duration of the check. When your character makes a combat check with a
  maser targeting a vehicle, your character may spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> on a successful
  check to inflict 5 system strain. Models Include: NEXT MX-990 Maser Cannon"
