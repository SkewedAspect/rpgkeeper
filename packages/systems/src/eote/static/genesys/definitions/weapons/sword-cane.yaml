name: Sword Cane
description: "A sword cane fits this setting quite well: a deadly weapon concealed in aristocratic accessories. The
  blade remains hidden in the cane, while the hilt is disguised as the cane's top. The sword cane has the Defensive
  quality (as do most swords), and it has a special rule to reflect how easy it is to hide. Those searching a character
  add <setback></setback> to any Perception checks they make to find the sword inside the cane."
