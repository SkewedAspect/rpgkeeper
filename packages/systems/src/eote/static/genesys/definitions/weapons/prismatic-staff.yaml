name: Prismatic Staff
description: "Prismatic Staffs were crafted by the students of Timmorran under his guidance. Their purpose was to
  provide the wizards with badges of office as well as a degree of personal protection. They are impressive artifacts:
  long shafts of silver topped with crystal orbs that display a shifting kaleidoscope of rainbow colors. A bewildering
  lightshow can be projected from the orbs, the intensity of which dazzles unwary opponents. A Prismatic Staff is a
  magic implement, as described on page 218 of the Genesys Core Rulebook. When your character casts a spell while using
  a Prismatic Staff, the first Range effect added to the spell does not increase the spell's difficulty. In addition,
  Attack spells cast by your character increase their base damage by three and gain the Disorient and Concussive 2 item
  qualities."
