name: Twin Letnev Poniards
description: "Seen throughout the galaxy as militaristic and stalwart, the Letnev possess countless traditions that can
  seem barbaric to outsiders. One such tradition is the Saliu'strebec, a martial art that uses two poniards while
  performing slow, methodical movements. Practitioners of this art understand that when sped up, the movement becomes a
  deadly flurry of attacks. The poniards used in this art are perfectly balanced twin blades that magnetically clip
  together when not in use. Twin poniards require two hands to wield. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural
  Manufacturing Differences."
