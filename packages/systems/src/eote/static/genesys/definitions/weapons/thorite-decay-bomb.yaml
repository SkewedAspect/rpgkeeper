name: Thorite Decay Bomb
description: "Designed by Clan of Saar cooperatives to assist in mining operations and later reengineered as a weapon,
  the thorite decay bomb creates a radioactive wave of superheated gases comparable to plasma bolts that incinerates
  anything it touches. However, the long-term effects of nausea, weakness, and acute radiation poisoning are what make
  it useful as a horrific weapon of war. When triggered, the Blast quality of this weapon hits all characters within
  short range, rather than all engaged characters. A character who suffers damage from a thorite decay bomb reduces
  their wound threshold by 4 and their strain threshold by 4. Their thresholds may be restored to normal with a
  successful <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>. Otherwise, after a week, the
  character may make a <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>. Each
  <success></success> increases their wound threshold and strain threshold by 1, up to their original wound and strain
  thresholds. This check may be repeated every subsequent week until the thresholds have returned to normal. This weapon
  may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
