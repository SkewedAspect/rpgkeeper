name: Thyrsus (Greek)
description: The sacred weapon of Dionysus, the Thyrsus is a rod with a pine cone at the end. Honey drips from the pine
  cone, and a steel tip is hidden within the cone's scales. This rare, but not unique, weapon can induce a sacred frenzy
  in its targets, and it has been carried by satyrs, maenads, and the god himself. While wielding the Thyrsus, if your
  character makes a combat check that would incapacitate a character, the character instead heals all strain, then
  lashes out in a frenzied, ecstatic rampage for the remainder of the encounter. During their turn, they must make a
  brawl combat check targeting the closest engaged character (if they are engaged with multiple characters, select the
  target randomly). If they are not engaged with any character, they move in a random direction performing random
  nonsensical acts determined by your GM.
