name: Plasma Scorpios
description: "The largest plasma weapons have the electromagnetic field generators necessary to fling larger plasma
  bolts over longer distances. When they detonate, their plasma blast is often enough to eliminate whole squads of enemy
  soldiers. The trade-off is their extreme bulkiness; they often require a tripod and time to deploy This weapon may be
  modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
