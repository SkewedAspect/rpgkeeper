name: Beam Rifle
description: "Primarily used by various armed forces, beam rifles use their bulky frame to support larger charge packs.
  Their searing beam cuts right through most body armor; the dazzling flash of massed laser fire was a horrifying sight
  throughout the galaxy during the Twilight Wars. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing
  Differences."
