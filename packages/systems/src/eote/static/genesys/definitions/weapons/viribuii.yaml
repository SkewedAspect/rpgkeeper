name: Viribuii
description: "Viribuii are essentially a slim set of exoskeletal supports that fit over the shoulders and down the arms
  of the wearer. Originally designed to aid in manual labor by a Lazax corporation, they spread throughout the Imperium
  until they were ubiquitous nearly everywhere. Unsurprisingly, they became popular as weapons when people realized that
  they were almost unnoticeable under clothing. Many viribuii in use today are designed solely as weapons, and some take
  advantage of the inbuilt power pack to power electrodes that can deliver punishing shocks. While wearing a viribuii, a
  character adds <success></success><success></success> to the results of all Athletics checks. This weapon may be
  modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
