name: Gauss Rifle
description: A gauss rifle uses an electromagnetic rail or coil to hurl a metal projectile over a long distance at
  incredible speed. The main drawback of this weapon is that it takes some time to recharge its capacitors after firing,
  so we gave it Slow-Firing (it's also important to do this for balance reasons, since this weapon is very powerful). We
  gave it Cumbersome as well, so a character needs to be strong to carry it around, or must use a bipod (see page 207).
