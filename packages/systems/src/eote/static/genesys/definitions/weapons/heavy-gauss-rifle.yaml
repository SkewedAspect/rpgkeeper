name: Heavy Gauss Rifle
description: "These powerful weapons are designed to destroy armor and fortifications at the edge of visual range. Heavy
  Gauss rifles are 25mm smoothbore weapons similar to a number of older light armored-vehicle cannons in both intended
  role and ballistic characteristics. Standard load is an inert ferrous penetrator with a buckyfilm-coated hardened
  tungsten tip. Very technically, Heavy Gauss rifles can be human-portable (with the aid of a tripod or load-bearing
  system), but more often are carried by exosuits. Models Include: Cantor LACR-01 Gauss-Effect Anti-Armor Cannon, NEXT
  CG70(H) Anti-Armor Gauss Rifle."
