name: Naalu Mind Blade
description: "Rarely seen outside Naalu rituals, the mind blade is a weapon found only in the deepest caverns of the
  naalu collective religious sects. Sought by many underworld collectors, the blades fetch small fortunes for
  adventurers foolish enough to seek out these antiquities. Although scientists are unsure how these devices work, few
  of the blades make it off Druaa and Maaluuk, and even fewer have ended up in a lab. When determining the base damage
  of this weapon, add the wielder's Willpower rating in addition to their Brawn. This weapon may be modified with 2-1:
  Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
