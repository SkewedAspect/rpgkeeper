name: Blast
description: The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or a similar area of effect, like a detonated grenade or
  a warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is successful and Blast activates, each character (friend or
  foe) engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast quality's rating, plus damage
  equal to the total <success></success> scored on the check. In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Game Master
  might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage. If the Blast quality doesn't activate, the ordnance still
  detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the firer (or quick reactions on the part of the targets) means the
  explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. However, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses by
  spending <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage>. In this case, the original target and
  every target engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.
