name: Prepare
description: Items with this quality require time to set up before being used. The user must perform a number of
  preparation maneuvers equal to the item's Prepare rating before using the item (if the item is a weapon, "using" it
  would be making attacks with the weapon). At your GM's discretion, moving with the item, being knocked prone with the
  item, or other disruptions may require the user to perform the preparation maneuvers again before using the item.
