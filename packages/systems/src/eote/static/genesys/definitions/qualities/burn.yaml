description: Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. When Burn is triggered, one target hit by the attack continues
  to suffer the weapon's base damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the weapon's Burn rating. Apply damage
  at the start of each of the target's turns. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Burn, the quality may
  be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time. A victim might be able to stop the damage by
  performing an action to roll around and make a Coordination check. The difficulty is
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> on hard surfaces such as the floor of a building, or an
  <difficulty></difficulty> on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage immediately. Both
  situations assume the flame is from actual combustion rather than a chemical reaction. With the latter, there is
  usually little the victim can do.
