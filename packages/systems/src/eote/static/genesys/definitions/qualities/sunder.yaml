name: Sunder
description: "When activating Sunder, the attacker chooses one item openly wielded by the target (such as a weapon,
  shield, or item on a belt). That item is damaged one step: to minor if undamaged, from minor to moderate, or from
  moderate to major. If an item already suffering major damage is the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed.
  Sunder requires <advantage></advantage> to activate, and may be activated even if the attack is unsuccessful. Sunder
  may be activated multiple times in the same attack, but each activation must be applied to the same item, potentially
  taking it from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack."
