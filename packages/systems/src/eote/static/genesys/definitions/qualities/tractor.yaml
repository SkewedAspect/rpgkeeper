name: Tractor
description: Instead of firing searing beams of laser fire or crackling ion discharges, this weapon fires relatively
  harmless electromagnetic beams that ensnare ships and hold them fast in space. Tractor beams, like all weapons, are
  fired at their target using the appropriate skill check with all suitable modifiers. Once the weapon hits its target,
  the target may not move unless its pilot makes a successful Piloting check with a difficulty equal to the tractor
  beam's rating. If the target is an individual character, the character is immobilized while the beam is active.
  (Weapons with the Tractor quality are only going to show up in science fiction settings, and probably only the more
  fanciful sci-fi settings! However, they are such a staple in those settings that we included the quality here.)
