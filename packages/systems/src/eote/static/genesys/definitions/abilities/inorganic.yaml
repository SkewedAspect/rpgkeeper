description: Since bioroids are inorganic, they do not gain the benefits of healing wounds with slap-patch (painkillers)
  or a Medicine check. Bioroids can heal wounds and strain naturally by resting, as their systems attempt self-repairs.
  Bioroids can also be "healed" by using the Mechanics skill instead of the Medicine skill, but otherwise following the
  rules in the Medical Care section on page 116 of the Genesys Core Rulebook.
