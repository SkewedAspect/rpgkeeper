name: Symbiotic Operation
description: When your character performs an action, choose whether the Naaz or the Rokha is performing the action; use
  that being's relevant characteristics, and use the appropriate skill from the shared skill list. When your character
  is targeted by an attack, skill check, or effect, as long as the Naaz and the Rokha are within short range of each
  other, choose which one is the target. In specific circumstances in which it may not make sense for you to choose
  which member of the pair acts or is targeted, your GM can make the decision instead.
