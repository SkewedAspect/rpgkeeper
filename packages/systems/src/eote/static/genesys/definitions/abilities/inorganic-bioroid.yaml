description: Since bioroids are inorganic, they do not gain the benefits of healing wounds with painkiller or a Medicine
  check. Bioroids can heal wounds and strain naturally by resting, as their systems attempt self-repairs. Bioroids can
  also be "healed" by using the Mechanics skill instead of the Medicine skill, but otherwise following the guidelines
  detailed on page 116.
