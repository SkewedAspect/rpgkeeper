description: Your character begins play with one gear (see page 104) that costs a total of 1,000 credits or less. They
  do not need to make any check to install this cybernetic, and they do not decrease their strain threshold because of
  this cybernetic (but will decrease their strain threshold as normal if they get any future cybernetics).
