description: Once per session, your character may use this talent to choose one non-nemesis adversary within medium
  range and make an opposed Negotiation versus Discipline check. If successful, the target becomes staggered until the
  end of their next turn. At your GM's discretion, you may spend <threat></threat> on this check to have the adversary
  become an ally until the end of the encounter. However, the duration of this may be shortened or extended depending on
  whether your GM feels your offer is appealing to the adversary and whether your character follows through on their
  offer!
