name: Teleportation
description: If your character has at least one rank in Arcana, once per session, your character may use this talent to
  make a <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>. If they
  succeed, they instantly vanish and reappear in any other location in the world they already know about. Your character
  may bring up to five allies with them when they teleport, but they must add <setback></setback> to the check for each
  ally. They may also teleport to different worlds or planes of existence; however, they must upgrade the difficulty of
  the check once (or more, at your GM's discretion) if they do so. Whenever your character uses this talent, your GM may
  spend <despair></despair> to have the teleportation miss the location by a range band per <despair></despair> spent,
  or may spend hhhh or d to have the teleportation go catastrophically wrong (by having a character materialize in a
  wall, another person, or midair, for instance, with the awful consequences to be determined by your GM).
