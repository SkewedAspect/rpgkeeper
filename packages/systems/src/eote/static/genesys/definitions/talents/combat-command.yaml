description: When your character makes a check to determine Initiative order (as described on page 95 of the Genesys
  Core Rulebook), they may make a <difficulty></difficulty> instead of using Cool or Vigilance. If your character does
  so, they may spend <threat></threat> from the check to add <success></success> to the results of all allies' checks
  made during the first round of the combat encounter. Your GM may determine that you cannot use this talent if your
  character is in no logical position to give orders, such as if they have no means of communicating with allies or are
  working with individuals who have no interest in listening to your character.
