description: "Once per session, your character may use this talent to make a Mechanics check to attempt to cobble
  together the functional equivalent of any item using spare parts or salvage. The difficulty of the check is based on
  the item's rarity; see I.4-1: Mad Inventor Item Rarity in the Genesys Core Rulebook. Your GM will modify the check
  based on the circumstances and might decide that some items simply can't be created with what's available (if you are
  being held in a prison cell, for instance). Your GM may spend <difficulty></difficulty> on the check to indicate the
  item ends up being dangerous to the user and anyone around them in some way. For instance, a pistol might explode
  instead of running out of ammo, or a breathing mask might make the user light-headed."
