description: When your character casts a Conjure spell using the Primal skill, they always add the Summon Ally effect
  without increasing the difficulty, and they must always summon a living animal (such as those starting on page 86).
  The animal remains for the duration of the encounter even if your character does not use a concentrate to maintain the
  spell. At your GM's discretion, the animal may have already been nearby rather than summoned from thin air. Likewise,
  at the end of the encounter, the animal may revert back to its natural behavior instead of vanishing.
