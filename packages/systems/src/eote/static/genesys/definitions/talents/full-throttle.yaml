description: While driving or flying, your character may use this talent to make a hard. If successful, the top speed of
  the vehicle increases by one (to a maximum of 5) for a number of rounds equal to your character's Cunning. The
  specifics of this talent require the optional vehicle rules, on page 220. If your game does not use these rules, this
  talent simply makes the vehicle go much faster than normal, with the specifics up to your GM.
