description: Once per encounter, you may spend a Story Point to have your character use this talent to target another
  character within hearing range, and tell them to perform a specific task. If your character knows the target's
  Strength or Desire Motivation, the target may reroll up to three dice of their choice during the next check they make
  to perform that task during the current encounter. This talent does not force the target to perform the designated
  task (it simply benefits them if they do so). In addition, the target becomes less hostile toward your character in
  the future.
