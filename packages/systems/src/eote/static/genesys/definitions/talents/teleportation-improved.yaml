name: Teleportation (Improved)
description: Your character must have purchased the Teleportation talent to benefit from this talent. Your character may
  use this talent to make a <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> to create a
  permanent beacon, glyph, or teleportation circle in a location (how it appears is up to you and your GM, but it should
  be large and noticeable). When your character uses the Teleportation talent, if they choose to teleport to the
  location of their beacon, glyph, or teleportation circle, the difficulty of the check is
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> and they do not add <setback></setback> for teleporting additional
  allies. They also do not upgrade the difficulty of the check to teleport to a different world or plane of existence.
  Your character can have two glyphs, beacons, or circles established at any one time per rank of Improved
  Teleportation. If they create any over this limit, one of the originals of your character's choice is destroyed.
