name: Call of the Moon
description: When the full moon rises, this character transforms into a monstrous wolf or giant hunting cat as an
  out-of-turn incidental; they heal all strain they are currently suffering, increase their Brawn and Agility by one to
  a maximum of 5, and reduce their Intellect and Willpower by one to a minimum of 1; all opponents must halve the damage
  dealt to this character while transformed before applying soak, unless their weapon is made of silver or uses silver
  ammunition; the transformation lasts until the following dawn or until this character is incapacitated due to
  exceeding their wound threshold.
