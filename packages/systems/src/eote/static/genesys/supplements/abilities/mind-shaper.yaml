description: As an action, a psionic may make an opposed Discipline versus Vigilance check targeting one living creature
  within medium range. If the check succeeds, the psionic may cause the target to adopt an emotional state of the
  psionic's choice for the next minute (or one round of structured time). <advantage></advantage> or <threat></threat>
  may be spent to increase the duration by one round (and may be spent multiple times). However, if the check fails or
  generates <despair></despair><despair></despair><despair></despair> or <difficulty></difficulty>, the target realizes
  their emotions are being manipulated.
