name: Curse of the Beast
description: While cursed shifters normally are human, when the full moon rises, they transform into a monstrous wolf or
  great cat (whether they can see the moon or not). The cursed shifter changes into their Beast Form as an out-of-turn
  incidental. This transformation lasts until the following dawn or until the cursed shifter is incapacitated due to
  exceeding their wound threshold.
