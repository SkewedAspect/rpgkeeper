description: When a non-Gashlai is engaged with a Gashlai, they are exposed to a fire with a rating of 5 (see page 111
  of the Core Rulebook). Gashlai do not suffer damage from weapons with the Burn item quality (whether or not the
  quality is activated). When a Gashlai who is not wearing a sealed environmental suit is present in any environment
  that does not have temperatures between 400 and 2,000 degrees Celsius, they suffer 1 strain at the end of each of
  their turns. If this causes them to exceed their strain threshold, they suffer one Critical Injury at the end of each
  of their turns as well, until they are able to return to a habitable environment.
