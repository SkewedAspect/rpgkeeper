name: Dominate
description: Once per encounter, as an action, may make an opposed Discipline check} against one living target within
  medium range. If successful, during the target's next turn, this character dictates what actions and maneuvers they
  perform. GMs should avoid actions that lead to unavoidable character death, however, such as jumping off towering
  cliffs or shooting oneself in the head, since that's just not fun.
