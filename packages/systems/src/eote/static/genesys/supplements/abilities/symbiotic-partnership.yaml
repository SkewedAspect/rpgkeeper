name: Symbiotic Partnership
description: A Naaz-Rokha is a single player character with two independent sets of characteristics and derived
  attributes. The Naaz and the Rokha operate as independent beings who share the same skills and talents. During the
  Naaz-Rokha's turn, as long as neither the Naaz nor the Rokha is incapacitated and they are within short range of each
  other, the Naaz-Rokha may perform one additional free maneuver without suffering strain (they may still only perform
  two maneuvers each turn).
