name: Beast Form
description: When the cursed shifter transforms into Beast Form, they heal all strain they are currently suffering,
  increase their brawn and agility by one to a maximum of 5, and reduce their intellect and willpower by one to a
  minimum of 1. Their unarmed attacks deal +3 damage and have a Critical rating of 2. All opponents must halve the
  damage dealt to a cursed shifter in Beast Form before applying soak, unless the weapon is made of silver or uses
  silver ammunition. Finally, the cursed shifter must make a
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> as an out-of-turn incidental when they
  transform. If they succeed, they may act normally, but if they fail, they give in to their animal instincts and must
  attack anyone around them with frenzied savagery (you should discuss the specifics of how they act with your GM, and
  it is up to your GM if they can make another attempt to regain control).
