description: Once per encounter, may suffer 3 strain and spend a maneuver to force all other characters within long
  range (or within earshot) to make a
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> as an out-of-turn
  incidental. If they fail, they must use their maneuver to move farther away; if they fail with <despair></despair>,
  they must also downgrade their action to an additional maneuver to move even farther away. If you're using the fear
  rules found on page 243 of the Genesys Core Rulebook, this can be a fear check instead.
