name: Rune of Blades
description: A rune of blades is almost always found with a specially made sword or knife. It is a simple and effective
  runebound shard that increases the potency of a bladed weapon by magically honing the edge. Like sunburst runes, runes
  of blades are in high demand among members of the military and can be commandeered from private individuals for war
  efforts and related campaigns. Some Dragonkin and other intelligent creatures have made use of the runes to retain the
  sharpness of their claws, though wooden edges and points are not affected by the runes.
useWith: This attachment can be applied to any bladed weapon.
modifiers: When this weapon inflicts a Critical Injury, it inflicts the Bleeding Out Critical Injury instead of one
  determined through rolling for the result.
