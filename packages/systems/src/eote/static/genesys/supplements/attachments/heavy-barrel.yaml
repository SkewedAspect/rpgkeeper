name: Heavy Barrel
description: The weapon's standard barrel, emitter, projector, or capacitors are modified to give the weapon the ability
  to fire a more powerful blast. Whatever form it takes, the heavy barrel attachment has a tendency to destabilize the
  weapon, making it harder for the shooter to land an accurate shot. Few can argue with the impactful results, however,
  when the weapon strikes true.
useWith: This attachment may be used with any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon.
modifiers: The weapon increases its base damage by 2 and gains the Inaccurate quality.
hpRequired: 2
