description: A common terror among frontline soldiers is the threat of their weapon running dry in the middle of a
  battle. Microreactors are prohibitively expensive (even the microentropic field taps recently designed by the
  Naaz-Rokha), but they can be installed into a weapon to provide a more lasting source of power.
useWith: This attachment may be applied to any energy-based Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), or Gunnery weapon.
modifiers: Difficulty may not be spent to cause this weapon to run out of ammo.
hpRequired: 1
