name: Duelist Cross Guard
description: This attachment represents modifying the cross guard of a sword to better catch and lock the blade of an
  opponent. This kind of attachment makes sense for the fantasy setting, but could make sense for any setting where
  dueling with swords is common.
useWith: This attachment can be applied to any sword, whether one-handed or two-handed.
modifiers: When an opponent resolves a melee combat check against the wielder, if the check generated at least one
  uncanceled Despair, the wielder may suffer 1 strain as an out-of-turn incidental to add Despair Despair to the
  results.
