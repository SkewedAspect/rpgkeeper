name: Silent Communication
description: Your character can soundlessly communicate messages to allies within short range. Allies cannot reply in
  turn (unless they also possess this talent). The complexity and length of a message may be limited by your GM during
  structured gameplay, as it is with spoken communication, or based on the current situation of environmental
  conditions. Increase the range of this talent by one range band for each additional rank of Silent Communication. This
  talent may be accomplished through thought-sending, pheromones, gravimetric pulses, strobing lights, or some other
  method that your character has established as a way for their allies to understand them.
