description: When your character purchases this talent, they increase the number of benchmarks they need to complete
  their current agenda and any future agendas they choose by 2 (see page 64). When they complete an agenda, they double
  the received rewards (if the rewards are difficult to quantify, your GM determines what an appropriate increase is).
  The rest of the party does not double any XP rewards they receive when your character completes their agenda.
