description: You may spend a Story Point to allow your character to use this talent to temporarily repair one damaged
  item they are engaged with. For a number of rounds equal to your character's ranks in Mechanics, the item may be used
  without penalty (see page 89 of the Genesys Core Rulebook), even if it is unusable. When the effect ends, the item is
  damaged one additional step; if it was already suffering from major damage, it is destroyed and cannot be repaired.
