name: Telekinesis
description: This talent costs 2 Æmber plus Æmber equal to your character's current ranks in this talent. Your character
  can manipulate objects and affect other characters within short range (as if they were engaged) using their mind
  instead of their physical body. When they do, any required skill checks linked to Brawn or Agility instead use
  Willpower. Similarly, to determine the encumbrance your character can telepathically lift or move use their Willpower
  in place of Brawn. Telekinetic movement is generally too slow and imprecise to effectively wield a weapon, but your
  character can lash out with mental force to make a Brawl combat check within short range. This attack has a base
  damage equal to your character's Willpower instead of Brawn and gains no benefit from weapons. The range of your
  character's telekinesis increases by one range band for each additional rank of this talent. <difficulty></difficulty>
  from a check your character makes using telekinesis may be spent to deplete this talent.
