name: Explosive Casting
description: When your character casts an attack spell, they treat the spell's Blast quality as having a rating equal to
  twice your character's ranks in Knowledge (instead of their ranks in Knowledge). When your character casts an Attack
  spell with the Blast effect, you may spend one Story Point to use this talent to trigger the spell's Blast quality,
  instead of spending <advantage></advantage> (even if the attack misses).
