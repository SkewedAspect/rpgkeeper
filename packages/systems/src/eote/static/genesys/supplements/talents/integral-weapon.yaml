description: "Your character must be a Titan to benefit from this talent. When you select this talent, choose one of the
  following weapons: an integral particle beam or an integral grav-field for one fist. Your character is equipped with
  the weapon you choose. Either weapon requires one free hand to use (as it is a part of your character's palm or hand).
  It cannot be disarmed or damaged, but a Critical Injury that affects your character's arm may cause it to become
  unusable temporarily or permanently at your GM's discretion."
