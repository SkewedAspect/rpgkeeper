name: Beam Fighter
description: While using a beam weapon with the Pierce item quality, your character may use this talent to cause the
  weapon to lose that quality. If they do, after your character makes a ranged combat check before the end of their
  turn, they may assign a number of additional hits from their weapon equal to the value of the Pierce item quality that
  the weapon lost. Each hit deals damage equal to the weapon's base damage plus the number of <success></success> scored
  on the check. Each hit must be assigned to a different target within short range of another target (each minion in a
  minion group counts as a target for the purposes of this talent).
