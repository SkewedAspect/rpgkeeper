name: Dormant Personality Overlay
description: When your character purchases this talent, select three skills that your character has one or no ranks in.
  Once per session, you may spend a Story Point to have your character use this talent. Until the end of the current
  encounter, they count as having four ranks in each of the selected skills and one fewer rank in all other skills. They
  also suffer 1 strain at the beginning of each of their turns. If they are incapacitated, the effects of this talent
  end. At your discretion, your character may also undergo some narrative personality shifts, such as not recognizing
  friends and family, behaving coldly and logically instead of in a friendly and relaxed manner, or constantly muttering
  a coded phrase under their breath.
