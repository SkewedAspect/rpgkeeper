description: Your character must have purchased the Aethersprite talent to benefit from this talent. If your character
  made a successful check to use the Aethersprite talent during the current encounter, you may spend a Story Point to
  have your character use this talent to make themselves and up to five allies invisible to any electronic sensors for a
  number of rounds equal to your character's ranks in Computers. This works on any electronic monitoring or surveillance
  systems, such as cameras, heat and motion sensors, and even microradar pulses. It also affects any nonsentient drones
  or robots that are linked with the network affected by Aethersprite.
