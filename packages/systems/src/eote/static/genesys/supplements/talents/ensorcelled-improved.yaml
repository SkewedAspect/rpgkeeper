name: Ensorcelled (Improved)
description: Your character must have purchased the Ensorcelled talent to benefit from this talent. If your character
  has at least two ranks in a magic skill, when using the Ensorcelled talent, they may add
  <success></success><advantage></advantage> to their next social skill check (instead of <advantage></advantage>).
  After purchasing this talent, your character's appearance is now noticeably changed by their magic. What form this
  enhancement takes is up to you, with your GM's approval, but it should be based on the magic skill your character
  possesses as well as the enhancement they originally possessed with the Ensorcelled talent.
