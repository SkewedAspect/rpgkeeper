name: Shapeshifter
description: "When your character is incapacitated due to having exceeded their strain threshold while in their normal
  form, they undergo the following change as an out-of-turn incidental: they heal all strain, increase their Brawn and
  Agility by one to a maximum of 5 and reduce their Intellect and Willpower by one to a minimum of 1. They deal +1
  damage when making unarmed attacks and their unarmed attacks have a Critical rating of 3, but they cannot use magic
  skills or make ranged attacks. Your GM should ensure that NPCs react appropriately to this (at the very least,
  upgrading the difficulty of social skill checks twice). Your character reverts to their normal form after eight hours
  or if they become incapacitated (for instance, by exceeding their wound or strain threshold)."
