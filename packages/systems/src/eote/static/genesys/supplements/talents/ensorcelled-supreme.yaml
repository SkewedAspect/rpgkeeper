name: Ensorcelled (Supreme)
description: Your character must have purchased the Ensorcelled (Improved). If your character has at least three ranks
  in a magic skill, once per session they may use this talent to force all enemies within medium range to make a
  <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty> as an out-of-turn incidental. If they
  fail, they must spend all available maneuvers moving away from your character, and they suffer 5 strain, plus 1
  additional strain per <despair></despair> (if your group is using the optional Fear rules on page 243 of the Core
  Rulebook, this can be treated as a fear check). What form this reveal takes is up to you, with your GM's approval, but
  is should be based on your character's magic skill and the enhancement they possess from the Ensorcelled (Improved)
  talent. Some possibilities include growing golden wings of light, manifesting demonic horns and glowing red eyes,
  rising into the air on a tornado, becoming a figure of pure shadow, or transforming into a massive treelike humanoid.
