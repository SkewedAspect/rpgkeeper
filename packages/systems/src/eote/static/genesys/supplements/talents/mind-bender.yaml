description: Your character must be a Druaa or have allegiance to the Naalu Collective to benefit from this talent. Once
  per session, your character may spend a Story Point to use this talent to make an opposed Discipline check} targeting
  one creature within medium range. If successful, your character may cause the target to adopt an emotional state of
  your character's choice for the remainder of the current encounter (or one hour in narrative gameplay). Your character
  may spend <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> or <threat></threat> to have the target unquestionably
  believe one piece of information of your character's choice for the remainder of the encounter, even if it is untrue.
  (Your character may do this multiple times, and they may even do this if the check fails.) At the end of the current
  encounter, at your GM's discretion the target may or may not continue to believe any information inserted in their
  mind, depending on how outlandish it is in the face of reality. However, if the check fails with
  <despair></despair><despair></despair><despair></despair> or <difficulty></difficulty>, the target knows that someone
  attempted to manipulate their mind.
