name: Slow-Firing
description: Slow-Firing weapons tend to deal incredible damage, but need time to recharge or cool down between shots. A
  weapon's Slow-Firing rating dictates the number of rounds that must pass before the weapon can be fired again after
  attacking. For example, a heavy laser cannon with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two rounds after being fired before it can
  be fired again.
