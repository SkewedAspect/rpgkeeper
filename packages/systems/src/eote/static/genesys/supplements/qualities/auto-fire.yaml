name: Auto-Fire
description: A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid succession and potentially spray an area with bolts,
  flechettes, slugs, or other types of projectiles. The advantage in using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit
  multiple targets or to hit a single target multiple times. As attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally less
  accurate, the attacker must increase the difficulty of the combat check by <difficulty></difficulty>. The user may
  choose not to use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case, they cannot trigger the quality but also do not
  suffer the aforementioned penalty. If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Auto-fire by spending
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage>. Auto-fire can be triggered multiple times. Each time the attacker
  triggers Auto-fire, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that
  weapon, and each hit deals base damage plus the number of <success></success> on the check. These additional hits can
  be allocated to the original target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. If the attacker wishes to hit
  multiple targets, they must decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if they wish to hit multiple
  targets, their initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is
  two separate targets, the GM chooses which is the initial target). The initial hit must always be against the initial
  target. Subsequent hits generated can be allocated to any of the other designated targets. Auto-fire weapons can also
  activate one Critical Injury for each hit generated on the attack, per the normal rules; the Critical Injury must be
  applied to the target of the specific hit.
