name: Praetorian Defender
description: "Pioneered by the Winnu, the praetorian is a popular weapon for the bodyguards of dignitaries. Though
  otherwise an accurate heavy beam pistol, the praetorian's bulky stock beneath its barrel houses a microtargeting
  savant. Your character may program the praetorian defender to recognize up to three different characters (each takes
  roughly a minute to program). When your character shoots at a target engaged with any of your allies, the GM may never
  spend <difficulty></difficulty> to hit one of the characters programmed into the pistol. This weapon may be modified
  with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
