name: Plasma Cannon
description: These weapons all fire spherical bolts of high-energy ionized gas. The exact chemicals and technology
  involved are sure to differ between manufacturers and species, but the result is devastating, superheated energy
  projectiles. Even the larger weapons in this category have a fairly limited range, since we figure the electromagnetic
  field generated for each projectile can only maintain its coherency for a short time. The bolts of superheated gas
  leave flesh sizzling and armor smoldering, hence the Burn quality. The largest weapons - plasma cannons - need time to
  cool down after each shot (hence the Slow-Firing quality).
