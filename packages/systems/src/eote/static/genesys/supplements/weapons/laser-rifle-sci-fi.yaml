name: Laser Rifle (Sci-Fi)
description: Laser weapons fire a beam of coherent light, causing damage through intense, searing heat. In this setting,
  we're assuming that handheld lasers are still being refined, so these early models have some drawbacks. One issue with
  laser weapons is beam diffusion over long distances, which is why our laser weapons are relatively short ranged. These
  lasers don't have a lot of penetration, since they expend their energy on the surface of whatever they hit, so no
  Pierce. But they are very accurate and can light targets on fire, hence the Accurate and Burn qualities.
