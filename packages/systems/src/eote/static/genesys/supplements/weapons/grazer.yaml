name: Grazer
description: "Gamma-ray lasers are the most energy-intensive beam weapons available to most of the galaxy. The highly
  focused pulsed grazer beam can pass right through heavy armor layers, wreaking havoc on the delicate circuitry or
  living tissue beneath. They require precision to use well, though, and thus grazer pistols tend to be a favored weapon
  of military officers and gunslingers. After your character makes a combat check with this weapon, your GM may spend
  <despair></despair><despair></despair> to have it run out of ammo. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural
  Manufacturing Differences."
