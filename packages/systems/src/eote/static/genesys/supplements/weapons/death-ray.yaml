name: Death Ray
description: Death rays are guns that fire a beam of energy with (as you might have guessed) deadly results. Each death
  ray is unique, the product of a deranged inventor or brainfried galvanist. The exact nature of the energy beam and its
  creation vary depending on the inventor. More than one inventor has claimed to have created their death ray for
  peaceful purposes, and that the existence of such a weapon will mean an end to war. Of course, it's actually only
  resulted in a death-ray arms race. Our death ray fires a beam of electricity, radiated ions, charged aether, or
  what-have-you in an erratic path, like that of a lightning bolt. This is why we've given it short range and the
  Inaccurate quality. In addition, it must recharge between shots, represented by Slow-Firing. It's still exceedingly
  deadly, of course. Having a Critical rating of 1 means that this thing could be very dangerous when used against
  player characters, so if you're a GM, think long and hard before you give this to an NPC!
