name: Hand Cannon
description: A hand cannon is quite literally a breech-loading, largebore pistol that operates much like its larger kin.
  The weapon is typically used for big-game hunting, and its effects on a human target are predictably devastating. The
  term is also sometimes applied to oversized revolvers with similar stopping power. While hand cannons of all makes
  generally take the form of a large pistol, the recoil is such that all but the largest and strongest individuals are
  advised to place both hands firmly on the grip before pulling the trigger. Someone firing a hand cannon probably has
  to brace themself to deal with the significant recoil, which we've represented with the Prepare quality. It has to
  reload, so characters only get one shot (but that's usually enough).
