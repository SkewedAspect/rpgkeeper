name: Flash Gun
description: Flash guns are a varied collection of weapons—submachine guns, automatic rifles, machine guns—fitted with
  propulsion units powered by Illirium batteries that give them unparalleled rates of fire and stopping power. The
  lingering effects of the energy propulsion system tend to rattle enemy troops they don't kill outright. This flash gun
  is based off of a basic submachine gun, while flash technology provides the Disorient and Pierce item qualities. Other
  flash guns can be created by using the rifle or pistol stats and adding Disorient and Pierce.
