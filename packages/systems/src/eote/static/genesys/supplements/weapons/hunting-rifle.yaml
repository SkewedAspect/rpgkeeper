name: Hunting Rifle
description: Hunting rifles are nearly as ubiquitous as pistols in developed countries with a long history of hunting
  and sporting. These rifles have long barrels and are often fitted with long-range telescopic sights to increase their
  performance and accuracy. The hunting rifle presented here is a double-barreled deer rifle in a standard hunting
  caliber like .30-06, .308, or 7 mm. You may reduce the damage by one for smaller varmint rifles, or increase it by one
  for big-game weapons like elephant guns. Most hunting rifles should have the Accurate quality, since they're built for
  single-shot accuracy. Finally, a hunting rifle can have an internal magazine. These rifles lose the Limited Ammo
  quality, but increase their price by 100.
