name: Stun Gun
description: The name "stun gun" is a bit of a misnomer; it's a hand-held device with protruding electrodes. Push the
  electrodes into an opponent, and they get shocked. That's why the weapon has damage that can't be modified by your
  character's Brawn (you don't hit people with a stun gun; you just touch them with it), and any similar weapon should
  follow a similar profile. Obviously, the Stun Damage quality is another must, and we added the Stun quality to
  represent some people suffering worse effects than others from the electric shock. We also gave it a Critical rating;
  after all, an electric shock can occasionally do lasting damage!
