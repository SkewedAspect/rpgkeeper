name: Charged Crystal Katana
description: "A strange anachronism even by melee weapon standards, the charged crystal katana is as much a work of art
  as it is a weapon. Carried by certain factions of the yakuza and other aspiring swordsmen, a CCK blade is constructed
  from a milky rose electroconductive crystalline lattice instead of folded steel or advanced alloys. A small power cell
  in the weapon's hilt sends an electrical charge through the blade, causing the crystals to align, which makes it
  almost indestructible and causes the blade to become nearly transparent. Hard to master and incredibly rare, charged
  crystal katanas are owned by only the wealthiest and most dedicated individuals. Although a charged crystal katana
  requires only one hand to wield, while wielded in both hands, it gains the Vicious 2 item quality. Models Include:
  None—each blade is handmade and unique."
