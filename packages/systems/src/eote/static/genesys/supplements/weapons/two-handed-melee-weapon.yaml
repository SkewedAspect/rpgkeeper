name: Two-Handed Melee Weapon
description: This weapon's relative bulk makes it easily noticed, and the wielder must use both hands to manipulate it
  effectively. The weapon is large enough that transporting it is awkward, so few carry such arms unless they expect to
  put them to use. Examples include a large club, a staff of stout titanwood, and a basic polearm.
