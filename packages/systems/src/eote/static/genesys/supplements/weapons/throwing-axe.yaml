description: "The rangers of the Dunwarr Mountains are fond of saying that the only thing better than an axe is an axe
  you can throw at someone. No amount of balancing a hand axe for throwing can make it a truly accurate weapon, but if
  it hits, it is likely to do some serious damage. Your character can hurl a throwing axe at their foe using the profile
  in 2-6: Ranged Weapons on page 95, or they can wield one using the following profile: [Table: Melee Stats]"
