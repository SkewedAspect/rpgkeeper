name: Machine Gun
description: Machine guns are large, heavy, often crew-served weapons. Depending on the type, a machine gun can be
  anything from a medium-weight, man-portable squad-support weapon to a heavy, turret-mounted .50 cal. The machine gun
  presented here can be used for any of the medium-caliber squad-support weapons like the M60, M249, or MG4. They're
  designed to be carried in the field, but they still have a high encumbrance (check out page 207 for rules for a bipod
  or tripod for this weapon). Heavier machine guns can have their damage increased by two, although you should increase
  their encumbrance and Cumbersome rating by two as well.
