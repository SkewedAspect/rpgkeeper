name: Stun Grenade
description: "Stun grenades fall into that gray area of \"ostensibly non-lethal but may still incapacitate or kill a
  target\" that's shared by so many less lethal weapons. They employ a high-intensity sonic pulse combined with an
  electric capacitor discharge to disorient and confuse enemy combatants. Stun grenades can be set to detonate on
  contact or set with a timer to detonate up to three rounds after being activated. Setting the timer can be done as an
  incidental. Models Include: NEXT M7 Sandman Flash-Bang Grenade."
