name: Hand Crossbow
description: A favorite weapon for assassins and bounty hunters, these small crossbows can easily fit under a cloak or
  can even be mounted on a reinforced glove. As such, they are frowned upon by many Town Watch members across Terrinoth,
  who view anyone they find carrying one with automatic suspicion.
