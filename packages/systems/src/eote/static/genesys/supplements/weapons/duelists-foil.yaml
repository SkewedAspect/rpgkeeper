name: Duelist's Foil
description: A duelist foil is an ideal weapon for an upper-crust individual. Although it is not as sturdy as a saver,
  the needle-thin blade can pierce through most armor. When a duelist foil is used to make a combat check, your GM may
  spend <despair></despair><despair></despair> to cause it to become damaged one step (see page 89 of the Core
  Rulebook).
