name: War Hammer
description: Some say the Dwarves of Forge first carried hammers to war when they took up their smithing tools to
  overthrow the Dragonlord Avox. Although this is almost assuredly a fanciful tale, many Dwarves (both those who live in
  Forge and those who live in the Dunwarr Mountains) wield these oversized mauls in battle. A proper war hammer must be
  balanced for combat, and even then, only the strongest warriors can carry it. A single, thunderous blow from a war
  hammer can leave any foe stunned and reeling—if the blow doesn't slay them outright!
