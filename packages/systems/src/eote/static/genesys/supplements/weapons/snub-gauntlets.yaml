name: Snub Gauntlets
description: "Coming in a pair and made of lightweight materials like lodinium microweave, snub gauntlets provide the
  wearer with added stopping power in hand-to-hand combat. Each gauntlet produces a constant kinetic charge that is
  amplified when it connects with a solid surface, producing a focused blast of kinetic energy. A character making a
  combat check with a snub gauntlet may trigger the Knockdown item quality by spending <advantage></advantage>. This
  weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
