name: DEW Rifle
description: Currently rare and experimental, directed energy weapons (DEWs) project highly focused energy (light,
  electricity, or more esoteric energy), rather than solid projectiles, at a target. Directed energy weapons are equal
  in power to lasers from other settings, but they tend to have a shorter range and to dissipate on the surface of a
  target (no Pierce quality). They more than make up for that by regularly setting targets on fire (via the Burn
  quality).
