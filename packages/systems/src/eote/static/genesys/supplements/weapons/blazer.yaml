name: Blazer
description: "Blazers, or beam weapons operating in the infrared spectrum, are less discriminate but just as dangerous
  as other beam weapons. Considered crude by most militaries, blazers lack any sort of tight beam focus and tend to
  expend their energy across the surface of their target. This makes them less effective against armor, but they can
  inflict catastrophic heating damage on exposed skin and delicate materials. They also have larger power packs that
  make these weapons bulkier. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
