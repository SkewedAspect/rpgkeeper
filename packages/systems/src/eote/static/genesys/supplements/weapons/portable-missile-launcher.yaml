name: Portable Missile Launcher
description: The weapon presented here represents one of the countless shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles used
  throughout the world, such as the Stinger missile. Their extreme range and Guided quality reflect the fact that they
  are long-ranged anti-vehicle weapons. They, of course, only hold one missile at a time and need a few moments to set
  up, so the Limited Ammo and Prepare qualities are a must for these weapons (reloads for these launchers should cost
  half of the weapon's initial cost). If you want to create an anti-armor weapon like a TOW, the Breach should be
  increased to 5 and Prepare to 2.
