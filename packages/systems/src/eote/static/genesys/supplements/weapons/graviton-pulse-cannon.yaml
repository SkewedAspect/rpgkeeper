name: Graviton Pulse Cannon
description: "Graviton pulse cannons are rare and esoteric weapons that use ruinous amounts of energy to fire a pulsed
  beam of gravitons at a target. The sudden localized increase of gravitational energy can pin soldiers in place, break
  bones and collapse lungs, and wreak havoc on the delicate mechanisms inside of armor plate. This weapon may be
  modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
