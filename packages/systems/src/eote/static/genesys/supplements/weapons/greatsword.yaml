id: genesys-weapon-greatsword
name: Greatsword
description: Almost any hand weapon can be found as a great weapon, although swords and axes are the most common. As you
  see from their stat lines, great weapons are devastating, but require impressive physical strength to swing (the
  greataxe) or coordination to keep their blade in the right place (the greatsword). The greataxe and greatsword also
  have some of the characteristics of their smaller cousins (Defensive and Vicious, respectively).
