name: Staff of Light
description: Priests of Pollux developed Staffs of Light as an alternative to the messy business of using torches and
  lamps for illumination. They are short and sturdy lengths of twisted wrought iron topped with a pearlescent jewel that
  glows with intense white light when a word of command is spoken. Usually the staffs are simply used in place of
  torches, but adventurers have been known to brandish these magical staffs at foes in order to dazzle them. Those with
  true magical skills, though, can use them for even greater tasks. A Staff of Light provides illumination out to short
  range. It is also a magic implement, as described on page 218 of the Genesys Core Rulebook, While using the Staff of
  Light as their implement, your character can use the Arcana skill to cast Heal spells. In addition, while your
  character casts a spell adding the Blast effect does not increase the spell's difficulty. Attack spells cast by your
  character increase their base damage by five.
