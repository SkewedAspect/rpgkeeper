name: Grazer Rifle
description: "Rifle-sized grazers are expensive and deadly weapons, meaning most militaries tend to purchase them for
  elite forces and commando teams. They also suffer the same problem with power requirements that other grazers do,
  tending to burn through power supplies rapidly. After your character makes a combat check with this weapon, your GM
  may spend <despair></despair><despair></despair> to have it run out of ammo. This weapon may be modified with 2-1:
  Cultural Manufacturing Differences."
