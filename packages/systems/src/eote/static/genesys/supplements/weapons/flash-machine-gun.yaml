name: Flash Machine Gun
description: The flash machine gun (the A6a) uses the same Illirium batteries as the flash gun to propel its rounds, but
  it shoots larger bullets at a higher rate of fire. Bulky and finicky, these new weapons are extremely good at pinning
  down enemy formations or scything through occult horrors. They are big and bulky enough that only the strongest
  individuals can wield them without a tripod or other support.
