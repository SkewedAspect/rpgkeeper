name: Guided Missile Launcher
description: 'Guided missile launchers are among the largest, most destructive human-portable weapons available. These
  reusable missile tubes fire powerful anti-aircraft and anti-armor missiles and can be equipped with all manner of
  standard and special warheads. Most guided missile launchers share the same general design principles as their
  ancestors from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. What sets these modern versions apart is the range and
  "intelligence" of the warhead. These days, a shoulder-fired missile can travel hundreds of kilometers, while its smart
  sensors can recognize a vehicle by the unique profile of its exhaust emissions or the electromagnetic signature of its
  hoverfoil rotors. Modern guided missile launchers can be fired and operated by a single person, although they tend to
  be bulky enough that the operator needs to be either fairly strong or wearing a powered exosuit. Models Include:
  Strelet Arms L101 Shooting Star Shoulder-Fired Missile Launcher.'
