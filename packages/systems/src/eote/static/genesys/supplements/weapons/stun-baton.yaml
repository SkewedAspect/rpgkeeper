name: Stun Baton
description: This is supposed to be a slightly more futuristic version of a police riot club, a weapon that shocks
  opponents into submission. One thing to note is that even though this is a Melee weapon, it doesn't add your
  character's Brawn to the damage (signified by the lack of a "+" before the damage value). Since the weapon discharges
  an electric shock whenever it touches an opponent, how hard your character swings it doesn't matter. Also, this weapon
  is non-lethal, so it has the Stun Damage quality.
