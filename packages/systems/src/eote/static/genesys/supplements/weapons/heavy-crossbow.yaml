name: Heavy Crossbow
description: Built for sieges and large battles, heavy crossbows have the power to punch a quarrel through a breastplate
  at a hundred paces. They are, however, cumbersome weapons. Some heavy crossbows even have siege bucklers attached just
  before the limbs, which only increases their weight. Recently, some of the baronies have begun fielding soldiers clad
  in plate mail and armed with heavy crossbows. The weight of their equipment makes them almost immobile, but they are
  nearly impervious to return fire and can hit nearly any target on the battlefield.
