name: Shikrai Needle Bow
description: "The Shikrai needle bow is an ancient yet deadly weapon used by skilled Shikrai hunters. The bow itself is
  a simple but durable weapon that may be made from any number of common and durable alloys. What is truly unique about
  the weapon is the arrows it fires. Each is crafted from a strand of pure bellidrium that has been molecularly bonded
  together. The bellidrium reacts in such a way as to create a virtually unbreakable shaft with a nearly frictionless
  surface tapering down to a molecularly sharp needle point. Only at the rear of the arrow, where the bonding process is
  interrupted to allow for the connection of stabilizing fins, can the arrow be grasped without slipping from one's
  fingers. The arrow can penetrate most forms of body armor with relatively minor force (although the narrow profile
  means it does surprisingly little damage when it hits). The bow and its arrows have no mechanisms of any kind, which
  makes them completely undetectable by all modern scanning devices. The shots are also completely silent, which may
  allow your character to make ranged combat checks while remaining hidden at your GM's discretion. Arrows can be
  recovered after firing if your character spends a few minutes gathering them up. New arrows can be purchased in
  quivers of ten, with a cost of 500 aurei per quiver. This weapon may be modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing
  Differences."
