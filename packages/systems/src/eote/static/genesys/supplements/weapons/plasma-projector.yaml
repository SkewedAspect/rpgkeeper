name: Plasma Projector
description: 'Truly nasty weapons, plasma projectors forgo creating bolts of plasma and instead use modified containment
  fields to project an electromagnetic cone away from the shooter. The plasma the projector sprays into the cone is more
  diffuse and cooler than the plasma in a standard plasma bolt, but "cooler" is a relative term when dealing with plasma
  weapons. Anything enveloped in the searing plasma spray is quickly engulfed in hungry flames. This weapon may be
  modified with 2-1: Cultural Manufacturing Differences.'
