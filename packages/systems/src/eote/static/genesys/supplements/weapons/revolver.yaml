description: "This is our profile for a standard revolver. Like the knife's, this profile is general enough that it
  could work for a sixshooter out of the 1800s, a sidearm in a steampunk universe, or something straight out of our own
  era. The weapon is a Ranged weapon, hence it uses the Ranged skill. Of course, if your setting breaks up Ranged into
  multiple skills, this would probably use Ranged (Light) since it's a pistol used in one hand. The damage reflects
  this: good damage for a pistol, but not comparable to a military rifle's. The same goes for the Crit rating. Rolling
  <advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage><advantage></advantage> on a check is a bit less
  likely, so it's going to take a skilled shot to make this weapon effective. We gave this a range of medium, which is
  typically the maximum range for pistols (some pistols are only useful at short range). The weapon's a bit bigger and
  bulkier than the knife, hence the higher encumbrance value of 2. Its cost reflects the higher cost of firearms, but it
  should still be fairly easy to find one. It also has one item quality, since revolvers tend to be accurate sidearms.
  You may be surprised that we didn't give it the Limited Ammo quality (for its six shots). However, we find in games
  that combat encounters tend to average around three to five rounds. If a weapon is unlikely to run out of ammo before
  combat ends, we recommend that it's not worth tracking ammo and that you should use the rules in the Tracking Ammo
  sidebar on page 89."
