name: Monofilament Grenade
description: "These modern fragmentation grenades are among the most vicious weapons produced today. Roughly the size of
  a clenched fist, these grenades consist of an explosive core wrapped in nearly a kilometer of monofilament and encased
  in a carbon-metallic shell. Upon detonation, the shell shatters, and the explosive spreads a deadly cloud of
  razor-sharp monofilament wire shards that can tear opponents to bloody shreds in seconds. Monofilament grenades can be
  set to detonate on contact or set with a timer to detonate up to three rounds after being activated. Setting the timer
  can be done as an incidental. Models Include: Taejo Technologies Mk IV Fragmentation Grenade, Springfield M11
  M-Grenade."
