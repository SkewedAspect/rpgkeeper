name: Glop Grenade
description: "Although officially dubbed \"non-lethal immobilization devices,\" cops and bounty hunters prefer their
  more accurate nickname. Glop grenades are as effective as they are gross, which means they're really good at
  immobilizing and trapping anyone within their sticky \"blast\" radius. The goo is a highly-compressed liquid that
  reacts and foams when exposed to air, turning into an incredibly sticky, foaming mass that fills a few square meters
  of space. Once someone is covered with the glop, the run the risk of gluing themselves to anything they touch. Glop
  grenades can be set to detonate on contact or set with a timer to detonate up to three rounds after being activated.
  Setting the timer can be done as an incidental. After being hit by a glop grenade, for the rest of the round your GM
  can spend <despair></despair><despair></despair><despair></despair> or <difficulty></difficulty> from any check your
  character makes to have them become immobilized until the end of their next turn. Models Include: NEXT Non-Lethal
  Immobilization Device"
