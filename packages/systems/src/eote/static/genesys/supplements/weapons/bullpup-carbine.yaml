name: Bullpup Carbine
description: "Although assault rifles remain the go-to infantry weapon for most militaries, many PMCs and corporate
  security outfits prefer to use the more compact and accurate \"bullpup\" weapons. Around since the beginning of the
  twenty-first century, the nickname refers to any firearm that has the action and clip behind the trigger, which allows
  for an easier to handle weapon. Although the first bullpup weapons tended to have some balance (and therefore
  accuracy) issues, modern smart systems eliminate this problem, letting wielders take full advantage of a shorter gun
  that's easy to swing around. Shorter ranged by nature, bullpup carbines tend to be used in enclosed spaces, and by
  criminals and security officers who like being able to hide an assault weapon in a briefcase. Models Include: Strelet
  Arms S101.b MCW, Kalashnikov AK-X2 Carbine."
