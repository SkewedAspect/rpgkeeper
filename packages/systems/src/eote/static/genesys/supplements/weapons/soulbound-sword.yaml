name: Soulbound Sword
description: Necromancers can bind the spirits of fearsome warriors within cursed blades. These soulbound swords have a
  sinister appearance, with morbid detailing such as skull-shaped pommels and guards made from carved bone. The black
  blades are slightly iridescent, and if an observer watches closely, they may be able to discern the shifting ghost
  trapped within. Bearers of these swords are said to benefit from some of the skill of the warrior spirit they carry,
  and the blades' merest touch often proves fatal. The grim reputation and appearance of Soulbound Swords also serves to
  inspire dread in their bearers' foes. While wielding or wearing a Soulbound Sword your character reduces their strain
  threshold by two. As an incidental, while wielding a Soulbound Sword your character can allow it to assist them; they
  make an immediate <difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty><difficulty></difficulty>, and all engaged
  characters make an identical fear check as an out-of-turn incidental. Assuming your character doesn't drop the sword
  in terror, they count as having four ranks in Melee (Heavy) for attacks using the Soulbound Sword for the duration of
  the encounter. If your character already has four ranks or more in Melee (Heavy), they instead add
  <boost></boost><boost></boost> to attacks using the sword. If your character fails the fear check with
  <difficulty></difficulty>, the spirit within the blade possesses them entirely for the rest of the encounter, or
  longer at your GM's discretion. Your and your GM should work together to determine your character’s actions while
  possessed.
