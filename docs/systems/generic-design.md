# Generic System Design

There's a good argument to be made for a generic system that lets you make a character for any system, roughly, to 
store your character in RPGKeeper. This would be a system that would let you define your own fields, and then store
the data in a JSON blob. This would be a good way to store characters for systems that don't have a system-specific
character sheet, or for systems that have a lot of variability in their character sheets.

_TODO: Design the rest of this._

## History

RPGKeeper originally had a generic system, but it was considered too complex and was removed. To see screenshots of the
original system, see the [screenshots](./generic/screenshots) directory.
